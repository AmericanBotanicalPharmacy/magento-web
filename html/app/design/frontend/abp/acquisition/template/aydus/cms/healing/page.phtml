			<p class="special">Hello Friends,</p>
			<p class="special">I’m Dr. Richard Schulze, and over the past 40 years, thousands of people have asked me the same question: What exactly is Natural Healing and how does it work?  So I’d like to take a few minutes to give you some of my insights and understanding of Natural Healing.  From spending decades in the clinic with thousands of patients, I found that it’s important for everyone to understand the basics of how and why your body will heal you of any disease and help you to create powerful health.</p>
			<div class="column1">
				<p><span class="special">So let’s get started.</span>  Natural Healing is a method of healing, or a different style or a type of healing than standard modern medicine.  With modern medicine, when you get sick, you usually take powerful chemical drugs or undergo something quite invasive, like surgery, to treat disease. With Natural Healing, instead you assist or encourage your body’s own natural self-healing ability.  There is a huge difference.  Simply put, Natural Healing is what your body does well, naturally, every day, with or without your help.  And when you get sick, it’s also what your body naturally does, which is heal you.</p>
				<p>Let me say that again. Your body is a self-repairing machine. One of your body’s primary and most basic functions is to repair itself whenever it’s injured, sick, or diseased. A great example of this is an ordinary cut or wound to your skin.</p>

				<!--<p>Let’s take a step back for a minute, and look at healing in general.  In medical school, one of the first things you learn is that your body is a self-repairing machine.  Let me say that again.  Your body is a self-repairing machine.  One of your body’s primary and most basic functions is to repair itself whenever it’s injured, sick, or diseased. A great example of this is an ordinary cut or wound to your skin.  When you injure your skin, you bleed. Your blood eventually clots, and you form a scab.  Your tissue and skin starts growing right underneath the scab, and eventually, the scab falls off and you have new flesh and new skin underneath, and you’re miraculously healed.  Even though we take this basic healing function for granted, no medical doctor and no hospital has ever been able to do this repair for you.  And no scientist has ever been able to make flesh and skin from blood, ever.  But your body can perform this healing miracle for you as a simple task.  This is just one example of how your body knows how to heal itself, and it also knows how to heal every disease known, including chronic and degenerative diseases, and it can do this.  It just needs a little assistance from you to do this type of advanced healing. </p>-->

			<p>Without a doubt, your body is an amazing healing and repairing machine, ready to repair any injury or take on any illness or any disease and completely heal you.  But eventually, with all of us, because of a combination of many things, from genetic weaknesses, maybe an unhealthy lifestyle and some bad habits, to just plain aging, and usually a combination of all three, your body may be not up to the task of healing or repairing you from an illness.  This is usually when a person develops a disease and then seeks out the help of a doctor, usually a medical doctor.  A medical doctor’s approach is to take on the healing project themselves, fighting and killing the diseases with a barrage of chemical drugs and often getting the body functioning again by performing surgical procedures.</p>

			<p>This form of healing can work, but it can also be very, very dangerous.  Sometimes, like with chemotherapy, radiation, and conventional cancer treatment, it is so strong and dangerous that they actually kill people before they kill the diseases.  In fact, even if medical treatment is successful, medical intervention is often so harsh and so extreme that it hurts other healthy organs and healthy systems and causes side effects, which is actually a soft name for causing new diseases in your body.  Trading one disease for another is not good medicine.  The medical approach can also leave you with irreversible surgical physical impairment when it involves your organs being altered or removed, and often the outcome of harsh medical intervention is that your life is changed in many ways, usually forever.   Worse, the practice of medicine is so dangerous, it is actually lethal.  In fact, today it’s estimated that death due to medical intervention – and this is often called iatrogenic death, which means physician-induced death.  Well, if you add up everything from drug overdoses, drug interactions, and side effects to the aftermath of intensive surgical procedures, well, the practice of modern medicine has killed millions and millions of people in just the last few years.</p>

			<p> It has been proven that organic food and herbs contain a much higher amount of nutrition and phytochemicals— up to 10 times more! This is a simple equation. Up to 10 times more nutrition and phytochemicals means that these herbs are up to 10 times more potent than non-organic herbs, which also means that you have an up to 10 times greater chance of getting the results you desire. Because, even more important than purity and powerful—is YOU! That’s the real bottom line, YOU getting healthy and YOU staying healthy. I take purity very seriously, to the extent that our manufacturing facility has been registered with, and is continually inspected by, the California Dept of Public Health: Food & Drug Branch, and we are licensed to manufacture ORGANIC Herbal Products. Furthermore, we have also been certified as an ORGANIC facility by Quality Assurance International, the top USDA accredited organic certifying agency in the United States.</p>

			<h3>MODERN MEDICINE IS NOT A GOOD CHOICE</h3>

		<div class="column1">
			<p>Medical intervention may be the best form of repair and healing for those people who will just absolutely not take any responsibility for their health, and they refuse to make any healthy and positive lifestyle modifications.  But for most people who are willing to make some changes and get a little healthier, modern medicine is not a good choice, and certainly not a good first choice.  So while the practice of medicine is actually trying to guess what’s wrong with you and then attempts to take over and force the healing process, natural healing is really the exact opposite.  With natural healing, we really don’t get involved in the healing process at all.  After all, your body knows a lot better than any doctor exactly what’s wrong with you, and it also knows exactly what to do.  All you need to do is to get healthier so your body becomes a more powerful and more effective repairing and healing machine.  Remember, this is what your body naturally wants to do anyway.  All by itself.  You’re just setting up the best possible environment for it to do its healing job.</p>

			<p>In my clinic, I soon discovered that with most people, it doesn’t actually take much to get their body tuned up to get their disease and illness.  With most people, I usually had to get them to just stop killing themselves.  What I mean is most of my patient’s diseases were caused by what they were doing to themselves.  In other words, their body was trying to heal itself, but it was too weak or running into too much resistance from their unhealthy lifestyle.  Most of my patients just needed a good, thorough cleanup, a new healthy lifestyle, and then their body would start to heal itself almost immediately, and then they were on their way to health.  A few of my patients, who had spent years making themselves sick, and ignoring their ill health and their many disease warning signs, well, they were now in a serious disease crisis.  And they needed a more aggressive health program.  Regardless of the level of my patients’ disease, even in the worst stages of chronic and degenerative disease, I always saw natural healing work as powerfully as medical intervention.  In fact, much better.  My patients were able to regain their health, in fact, create powerful health, by creating a very healthy life.</p>

			<h3>IT WAS EASY, AND IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.</h3><br>
			<p>With natural healing, the healing results are a direct reflection of how many positive and healthy changes a person is willing to make.  For most people, it was easy, and it was a lot of fun.  And when you compare it to the drama, trauma, pain, torture, and financial expense of medical intervention, for most people with good common sense, choosing natural healing, well, it’s a no-brainer.  As I said, natural healing is for people who are willing to make healthy and positive lifestyle changes.  As a natural doctor, that’s what I do.  I help people to make healthier choices in their life and create a healthier lifestyle, which will in turn dramatically raise their level of health, which in turn dramatically increases their body’s ability to heal and repair itself.</p>

			<p>Look.  To sum this all up, natural healing is a style of healing where you assist your body to charge up its own natural and powerful self-healing ability. When you create a lifestyle where you eliminate the many things that cause the disease, and increase those things that create powerful health, well, your body will get healthier and stronger.  And when it’s strong enough, it repairs and rebuilds any injury and heals any disease.  I made a sign that I hung in my clinic for years.  And today it hangs in my pharmacy store.  It reads, “You can heal yourself of anything and any disease.  Just stop doing what makes you sick, and start doing what creates powerful health.” There’s a very old proverb that says, “Focus on the good to eliminate the bad.”  This proverb is a great description of natural healing.  In the same way, natural healing is about focusing on the good, which is focusing on creating a healthy life, and having a lot of fun doing this, and then letting your body take care of what it knows better than any doctor and what it does best, which is repair and heal you of anything.</p>
