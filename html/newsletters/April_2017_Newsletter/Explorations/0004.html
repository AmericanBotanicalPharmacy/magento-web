In fact, it does&nbsp;more jobs for you than any other organ in your body. Medical science is still discovering the many functions it does for you, and in my&nbsp;opinion, they will never know everything. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle13">What we do know is that it creates glucose, the&nbsp;body’s only chemical that gives us pure ENERGY to do the things we want to do in life. That alone is a great reason to keep your liver clean and healthy.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle13">But more than that, it also creates digestive&nbsp;fluids needed to digest foods, along with enzymes that neutralize&nbsp;toxic poisons in your blood. It also creates hormones, breaks down fats,&nbsp;kills bacteria and viruses, synthesizes protein and stores everything&nbsp;from immune cells to iron to Vitamins A, B-12, D, E, K and on&nbsp;and on and on…</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14"><span class="autoCharStyle11">MORE ENERGY</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle13">It’s your liver’s job to convert carbohydrates you eat into glucose.&nbsp;Glucose is the primary ENERGY source of the human body. Your&nbsp;liver makes glucose and then stores it for you as a reserve energy&nbsp;supply. When you need energy anytime, 24/7, your liver releases this&nbsp;stored glucose, and WOW, you get an energy blast second to none,&nbsp;better than coffee! Keeping your liver healthy and clean simply helps&nbsp;you have all the energy you need, whenever you need it.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14"><span class="autoCharStyle11">PROTECTS YOU</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle13">Modern living in most of the civilized world&nbsp;is a toxic, poisonous and actually lethal experience. What is&nbsp;in your food, water and air is trying to create disease and kill you&nbsp;every second of every day. Thank God for your liver, because it’s&nbsp;saving your life, every day. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle13">Your liver is the ultimate&nbsp;detoxification organ in your body.&nbsp;Unfortunately, in our modern world, most of the food you consume is&nbsp;dusted with, grown with, dipped in, sprayed,&nbsp;mixed, colored, flavored and&nbsp;preserved with thousands of&nbsp;different toxic chemicals, and then&nbsp;packaged in toxic containers. It’s the same with the&nbsp;water you drink and the air you&nbsp;breathe.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle13">Everything you eat and drink is digested and then travels through your liver FIRST, before entering your bloodstream to feed&nbsp;every cell in your body. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle13">Think about it, my friends, considering&nbsp;that there are about 100,000 new chemicals floating around in&nbsp;our environment, and our bodies, a little flushing, cleaning and&nbsp;protecting of your liver once a year doesn’t seem so extreme, does it? The bottom line, keeping your liver healthy… keeps you healthy. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14"><span class="autoCharStyle11">PREVENTS DISEASE</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle15">Your liver removes all of this harmful material from your blood&nbsp;that, if left behind, will cause heart attacks, strokes, circulatory&nbsp;disease, cancer, neurological diseases and a hundred other diseases.&nbsp;This is why many doctors will often say that, when you have&nbsp;almost any disease, your liver was sick long before your disease&nbsp;developed.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14"><span class="autoCharStyle11">SO CLEAN IT</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle13">The bottom line is that there is no escape from the toxic, environmental overload on your liver. If you live anywhere on this planet (and especially in America), your liver is likely overworked&nbsp;and congested with the toxic waste it has been constantly trying to keep out of your body and bloodstream. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle13">Liver flushing and cleansing causes the liver to&nbsp;empty its toxic contents, so it can start fresh, work more efficiently, to give you many more years of trouble-free service.</p>  </div>  <div id="item35163" class="pageItem" alt="Your Liver: Why It’s So Important">    <p class="autoParaStyle17">Your Liver:<span class="autoCharStyle12"><br /></span>    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle16">Why It’s So </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle16">Important</p>  </div>  <div id="item36189" class="pageItem fauxgroup" alt="Rectangle"><img src="assets/images/item_36193.png" class="pageItem" alt="EPS" style="left:16px;top:9px;"/>  </div></div><nav><button id="nextBtn" name="nextBtn">&nbsp;</button><button id="backBtn" name="backBtn">&nbsp;</button></nav><div id="prefooter" style="float:left;height:1px;">&nbsp;</div></div><div id="in5footer">Built with <a href="http://ajarproductions.com/pages/products/in5/?ref=footer" target="_blank" >In5</a>.</div></body></html>
