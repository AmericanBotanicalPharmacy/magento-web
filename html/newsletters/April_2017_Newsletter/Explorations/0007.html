In fact,...">    <p class="autoParaStyle30">Given our modern world, this means your liver has the single most stressful job in your body…by a long shot. In fact, if you were asked to choose between being an air-traffic controller at Los Angeles Airport, or doing the job of a liver for one day, you’d be smart to take the air-traffic controller job.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30">As you saw on the previous pages, your liver is responsible for over 260 unique functions within your body, and all of them are designed to keep your body running clean and efficient. Bottom line, your liver is keeping you alive every second of every day, and it NEVER gets a break.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30">This is because the liver is involved, one way or another, in nearly every bodily process, with its focus on the crucial job of DETOXIFYING the body at every step. This need for your body to detoxify is more important than ever before, because we live in a more toxic environment than ever before in history.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30">First, our modern American diet, rich in animal flesh, fried foods, refined oils, and chemical additives, will weaken and overload your liver.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30">Add in alcohol, tobacco, and environmental pollution, and the liver is starting to get severely overworked. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30">Now, add the stress of modern life, along with all of the environmental toxins we are absorbing every second, from the air we breathe, to the clothes we wear, the furniture we sit on, the rooms we spend time in…and WOW, toxins are EVERYWHERE! </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30">Is it really any surprise our livers are so overwhelmed, and possibly even sick?</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30">Despite the stacked odds against a healthy liver, the amazing reality is that optimum liver function can be restored, and even a damaged liver is<br />able to regenerate, much like skin heals and regrows after its been cut. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30">The bad news is that an overloaded liver can be hurt, sick and damaged for a very LONG TIME before its energy reserves are pushed so hard that disease and deterioration are even detected.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30">This is why Dr. Schulze says:</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle30"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle29"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle29"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle29"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle29"><br /></p>  </div>  <div id="item32767" class="pageItem" alt="Liver Cleansing: Why Everyone Needs It">    <p class="autoParaStyle16"><span class="autoCharStyle21">Liver Cleansing: </span>Why Everyone Needs It    </p>  </div><img src="assets/images/item_32838.png" class="pageItem" alt="                               " title="                               " style="left:-9px;top:615px;"/><img src="assets/images/item_32848.png" class="pageItem" alt="Capao Bonito, Sao Paulo, Brazil, December 18, 2009.
