The tasks are up to 260 unique functions...and counting. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">Bottom line, your liver has numerous different&nbsp;microscopic functional units and is as complex and infinite as outer&nbsp;space!</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">One of the main reasons I know God was a Natural Healer&nbsp;(and NOT a medical doctor) is the liver itself. It is so incredibly&nbsp;complex that it’s best to just leave it alone and create a&nbsp;healing lifestyle for it, and DON’T TOUCH IT, HANDS OFF.&nbsp;</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">Now, let me try to boil it down and make understanding the&nbsp;functions of the liver as simple as possible…</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle20"><span class="autoCharStyle16">first line of defense</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">First, your entire blood supply passes through your liver, especially the blood from your digestive organs, which contains nutrition and end-products&nbsp;of digestion. This happens BEFORE this blood enters your general&nbsp;circulation to the rest of your body. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">To simplify it further, your liver is the DEFENSIVE BARRIER between the things you take into your body and the blood&nbsp;that feeds that body, which is why it is often called “your first line of&nbsp;defense”. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle21"><span class="autoCharStyle16">Energy &amp; Nutrition</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">Your liver is your life force, the source for your ENERGY.&nbsp;Your liver synthesizes the sugar&nbsp;glucose from carbohydrates&nbsp;or starches that you eat.&nbsp;Glucose is the most important&nbsp;carbohydrate in your body’s&nbsp;metabolism. It could just be&nbsp;called PURE ENERGY,&nbsp;because it is used by your brain&nbsp;and every other cell of the body&nbsp;for just that: ENERGY. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">If you’re feeling low energy, fatigued and sluggish, no matter how much sleep you’re getting or how well you’re eating…it’s time to do a liver cleanse.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle20"><span class="autoCharStyle16">Detoxification</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">Your liver is the blood detoxification organ in your body.&nbsp;The liver detoxifies, neutralizes, renders&nbsp;harmless and eliminates all of the harmful toxic poisons, chemicals and&nbsp;substances you may ingest, and keeps them out of your bloodstream.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">It produces many different enzymes&nbsp;that actually convert toxic poisons into harmless chemicals and&nbsp;then they are eliminated in the bile that your liver excretes.&nbsp;</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle19">The main idea in Natural Healing (as opposed to conventional&nbsp;medicine) is to prevent disease and protect your body, before it&nbsp;gets sick. And your liver (more than any other organ in your body)&nbsp;<br />prevents you from getting sick!</p>  </div>  <div id="item34946" class="pageItem" alt="How Your Liver WORKS">    <p class="autoParaStyle22">How Your </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle22">Liver <span class="autoCharStyle17">WORKS</span>    </p>  </div>  <div id="item35076" class="pageItem" alt="Even conventional doctors will tell you that long before most diseases surface, often the liver was overloaded, weak ...">    <p class="autoParaStyle23">Even conventional doctors will tell you that long before&nbsp;most diseases surface, often the liver was overloaded, weak and unable to&nbsp;perform its job. That’s why it is so important to cleanse your liver&nbsp;on a regular basis. It literally helps EVERY system of your body to work better, and stay healthier.</p>  </div></div><nav><button id="nextBtn" name="nextBtn">&nbsp;</button><button id="backBtn" name="backBtn">&nbsp;</button></nav><div id="prefooter" style="float:left;height:1px;">&nbsp;</div></div><div id="in5footer">Built with <a href="http://ajarproductions.com/pages/products/in5/?ref=footer" target="_blank" >In5</a>.</div></body></html>
