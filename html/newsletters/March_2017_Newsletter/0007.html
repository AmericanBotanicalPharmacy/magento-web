In the case of Elvis Presley, his bowel had expanded from 5-feet to almost 9-feet long, with nearly 50 pounds of excess fecal matter stuck in it. Unfortunately, there are many, many Americans just like him who are dying every day from the excess hard, dry, impacted toxic waste in their colon.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle44"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle45">Worse, when the large intestine gets backed-up with waste, the small intestine can also become backed-up. And, once the tiny villi of the small intestine are covered in waste, they can no longer absorb nutrients. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle44">If this happens, no matter how many changes you make to your food program, or how healthy you begin to eat, the villi cannot get to this nutrition because they are covered in old waste, feeding off of this rancid garbage and making you sicker every day.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle44"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle44">This is exactly how backed-up waste and blockage leads to major disease in the body.&nbsp;Without proper hydration, nutrition, and a thorough cleansing of the colon on a regular basis, every system of the body suffers. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle44"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle44">This is why a seasonal Bowel Detox was MANDATORY in Dr. Schulze’s clinic, and why 4 out of every 5 patients were completely healed after completing a thorough bowel detox program.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle44"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle43">This is why Dr. Schulze always says:</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle42"><span class="autoCharStyle21">“No matter how far removed the problem seems from the colon, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to do a bowel cleansing program instead of brain surgery, cleanse the bowel first and see what happens.” </span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle41">— Dr. Schulze</p>  </div>  <div id="item29825" class="pageItem" alt="Bowel Cleansing: Why It’s So Important">    <p class="Big-Head">Bowel Cleansing:</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle48">Why It’s So Important</p>  </div>  <div id="item29897" class="pageItem" alt="“It is our fiberless American junk food diets, and lack of exercise, that causes the average American to be 70,000 bo...">    <p class="autoParaStyle49">“It is our fiberless American junk food diets, and lack of exercise, that causes the average American to be 70,000 bowel movements SHORT in their lifetime!”</p>  </div></div><nav><button id="nextBtn" name="nextBtn">&nbsp;</button><button id="backBtn" name="backBtn">&nbsp;</button></nav><div id="prefooter" style="float:left;height:1px;">&nbsp;</div></div><div id="in5footer">Built with <a href="http://ajarproductions.com/pages/products/in5/?ref=footer" target="_blank" >In5</a>.</div></body></html>
