Our lack of attention on good elimination and <span class="autoCharStyle8">digestive health has awarded Americans </span>with the highest level of digestive <span class="autoCharStyle8">disorders, bowel disease and colon cancer </span>in the WORLD. That’s right, we’re #1!<br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle15"><span class="autoCharStyle5">HOW DID WE GET HERE?</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">Every single patient in my clinic had retained waste or some type of blockage somewhere in their body, and most often it was in their bowel.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">First, ALL animal food—meat, eggs and dairy—has absolutely NO fiber. So, when we eat it, it’s really hard to get that grease and fat out of our bowel. Add in wheat and flour products, and now you have a heavy paste.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">Second, we don’t move our bodies much, and a sedentary lifestyle promotes constipation. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">Third, in America we have way too much stress, major stress, and stress also causes constipation.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">Add this all up, and you can clearly see why Americans not only have the highest incidence of constipation, but they also have the highest incidence of colon and rectal disease on the planet.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">Even worse, retained fecal waste causes everything from bad skin, bad breath and backaches, to headaches and low energy and contributes to the worsening of every known major disease. In my clinic, besides increased nutrition, a thorough BOWEL CLEANSING had the biggest impact to solve chronic health problems and greatly increase my patients’ overall health.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">My patients were always so amazed at how much better they felt after having regular and complete bowel movements.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle16">WHY BOWEL CLEANSING IS<br />SO IMPORTANT…<br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle15"><span class="autoCharStyle5">ACCUMULATED WASTE</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">The human body is a metabolic engine. Every system, every organ, and every cell of the human body takes in fuel to run and eliminate waste material. The majority of this waste is deposited into your colon. </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">In fact, the average American stores from 10 to 12 pounds of fecal matter in his or her colon. If this toxic waste isn’t regularly eliminated, it will cause your body to be backed up with poisons, making it sluggish and unhealthy.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle15"><span class="autoCharStyle5">CONSTIPATION</span><br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle14">This body of ours must have had some incredible engineer. Everything has its place and there is no extra room. If one organ swells, then another organ gets compressed or crushed. Organs don’t work well when they are crushed, and circulation gets interrupted. Every organ needs good circulation to bring nutrition in and get </p>  </div>  <div id="item30985" class="pageItem" alt="Cleanse Your Bowel, Save Your Life.">    <p class="autoParaStyle19"><span class="autoCharStyle9">Cleanse</span> Your Bowel,<br />    </p>    <p class="autoParaStyle18">Save Your Life.</p>  </div><img src="assets/images/item_31008.jpg" class="pageItem" alt="Protein diet: raw products on the wooden background" title="Protein diet: raw products on the wooden background" style="left:-9px;top:323px;"/><img src="assets/images/item_31017.jpg" class="pageItem" alt="Man at home with a tablet and a dog" title="Man at home with a tablet and a dog" style="left:-9px;top:432px;"/><img src="assets/images/item_31027.jpg" class="pageItem" alt="Photo of a couple going through  financials problems" title="Photo of a couple going through  financials problems" style="left:-9px;top:543px;"/><img src="assets/images/item_31036.png" class="pageItem" alt="&quot;Young woman holding her lower abdomen, in pain due to cramps or a stomachache.
