Chewing your food well is the first step to good digestion. From here, the food moves down your esophagus and into your stomach.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40">As the food enters the stomach, there are two acids that are immediately excreted—hydrochloric acid and pepsin—which continue breaking down your food into its basic molecular parts (vitamins, nutrients, etc).&nbsp;</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40">Your food, now more of a watery-mash consistency, moves on to the duodenum. In the duodenum, there is bile from the gallbladder along with enzymes from the pancreas that continue to break the food down for assimilation into your body and bloodstream.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40">From here, your food moves into the small intestine, which is about 1-inch in diameter and nearly 25 feet long. This 25 feet of tubing makes a hairpin turn every 2-inches, so keeping all of the food moving is very important and not as easy as it sounds. Most important, this is where you finally begin to absorb the nutrients, vitamins and minerals that are in your food!&nbsp;</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40">In the small intestine, food particles begin to attach themselves to the villi for absorption. Villi are tiny hair-like fibers that line the walls of your small intestine. These villi absorb all of the food molecules (nutrients, toxins, everything you’ve eaten) and take these particles up to the liver to be assimilated into your bloodstream. The liver then separates what the body needs (nutrients) from what it doesn’t need (toxins), and sends the good stuff to your cells and the bad stuff to your large intestine for removal.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40">Excess waste is also deposited into your large intestine (also known as the bowel or colon) from the small intestine. The bowel is 4 to 5-inches in diameter and 5 feet long. It is often called the “sewer system” of the digestive tract. The bowel is where the majority of water is absorbed from the food you’ve consumed. As the waste moves from liquid to a more solid consistency, it is eliminated through the rectum and anus.&nbsp;</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40">If the food you consume is high in nutrients, fiber, and water (and also low in indigestible junk foods and sugar), this digestive process should work very efficiently to ensure every cell is getting proper nutrition for survival. But, this is almost impossible in our modern world of fast foods and process foods, where chemicals and additives can be found in nearly everything we consume.</p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40"><br /></p>    <p class="autoParaStyle40">Unfortunately, no matter how well you try to eat, most people consume far too much food that is high in fat, high in sugar, low in nutrition, and usually with ZERO fiber, which all contribute to a BLOCKAGE of the colon. Once constipation sets-in, all the food you eat slowly putrefies, proteins rot, carbs ferment, oils and fats turn rancid, and the body becomes poisoned by its own waste.</p>  </div></div><nav><button id="nextBtn" name="nextBtn">&nbsp;</button><button id="backBtn" name="backBtn">&nbsp;</button></nav><div id="prefooter" style="float:left;height:1px;">&nbsp;</div></div><div id="in5footer">Built with <a href="http://ajarproductions.com/pages/products/in5/?ref=footer" target="_blank" >In5</a>.</div></body></html>
