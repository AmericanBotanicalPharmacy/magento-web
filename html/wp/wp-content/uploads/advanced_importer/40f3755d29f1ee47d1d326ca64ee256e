		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style=&#x0027;text-align: center;&#x0027;>&#x201C;To Everything, <em>turn, turn, turn</em><br>
There is a Season, <em>turn, turn, turn</em><br /><!--more-->
And a time for every purpose under heaven.&#x201D;
</p><p>
Whether you follow the words of Pete Seeger, or the Byrds&#x0027; 1965 folk-rock hit recording, or the scriptures of the Christian Bible or Hebrew Tanakh, or just the words of Ecclesiastes, the son of David or King Solomon, it does not matter to me. There are a thousand different ideas and translations of this writing that is thousands of years old. And, while some religious scholars say that this story is to remind us that our life is meaningless, others say that it is to remind us of just the opposite, to focus on the simple things in life like eating and drinking and remembering that life is temporary or transitory. It really doesn&#x0027;t matter to me, and anyway, I am way to wise to debate politics or religion with anyone, and what I am sharing with you doesn&#x0027;t come from either rock-and-roll or religion, but instead it comes from my heart.
</p><p>
Life to me is the greatest gift and blessing we shall ever receive while we are physically alive. This is it. You can live it to your fullest potential, squeeze every drop of life, <em>out of life</em>, be all that you can be and share your wonderful highest self with your family, friends and others, or you can shrivel, watch television, get diseased and waste away, it&#x0027;s your call. I heard someone say once that life is a terminal disease. I prefer to look at it more as a &#x201C;limited time offer&#x201D; so therefore I want to take full advantage of this incredible deal. 
</p><p>
One technique I use to keep my consciousness and stay awake, so I remember to take full advantage of my gift of life, is through seasons. I find that years are too long for me to remember what I want, what I am doing and where I am going. But seasons, a <em>check-in</em> or <em>checkpoint</em> every three months, this works for me as it did for my patients. It also blends well with the planetary movements, such as the longest day and shortest day of the year and the midpoints of these. This is one reason I create a new Seasonal Report and Herbal Products Catalog, <span style=&#x0027;font-weight:bold;&#x0027;><em>every season</em></span>. It works for me therefore I have always counted my life in seasons. To me, the seasons are great bookmarks in my life. A new season is a wonderful time for me to pause for a few days and reflect on what I have done in the previous season.
</p><p>
I like to take a breath, and rest for a few days and do a cleansing program, usually one of my 5-Day Detox programs. What I receive from taking this break, and getting more rested and cleaner, is that I become <span style=&#x0027;font-weight:bold;&#x0027;>more energized</span> and <span style=&#x0027;font-weight:bold;&#x0027;>much more clear and focused.</span> This helps me to further sharpen my focus in life, to effectively do more of what I want and therefore get more of what I want to accomplish out of life. Four times a year I refine my <em>self</em> and my <em>life</em>, to create an even better me (and life) during the next season.
</p><p>
For me, the beginning of each new season is a time for reflection, healing and renewed focus. It is a time for me to make subtle shifts, minor adjustments and even some big changes that I need to sometimes make to get it even more on track with my goals of what I want. As I said, sometimes these adjustments are subtle, and sometimes they are huge. I prefer to make rock solid &#x201C;baby steps&#x201D;. In other words, I like to make small shifts and changes in my physical, emotional and spiritual life to keep nudging myself onto a more finely tuned path. But occasionally in my life, if I find myself out of balance or ill, I have had to make rapid dramatic life shifts, and these are great too. But, with most of my patients, if they weren&#x0027;t at death&#x0027;s doorstep with a deadly disease, I would prefer to take an entire season or three months to teach them a new healthier way of living, and then help them refine and perfect this new life over a period of years, if not their lifetime.
</p><p>
I find that most people I meet pay little attention to what they have created in life, and even less attention to what they want and where they are headed. This is called living unconsciously. These types of people are usually very surprised when they become ill or diseased, they didn&#x0027;t see it coming. These people are victims to life and usually believe that you can&#x0027;t change your fate, you have no control over life and that shit happens.
</p><p>
On the other hand, I pay a lot of attention. I like to live consciously and responsibly. I am aware that I want more than most people out of life. Therefore, I take full responsibility for my actions, from everything I eat, drink and think, to every word I speak. I also take full responsibility for my outcomes, and if I am not getting what I want, I make more shifts, adjustments and changes. It&#x0027;s that simple.
</p><p>
Life is a PERFECT reflection of everything you are doing, so if you don&#x0027;t like what you have created, CHANGE. You know, you reap whatsoever you sow. People will try to tell me that they really didn&#x0027;t create their dilemmas in life. Well, then who did? RESPONSIBILITY is the fundamental key word in Natural Healing, PERIOD. Look friends, I am not <span style=&#x0027;font-weight:bold;&#x0027;>perfect</span>, but I am constantly <span style=&#x0027;font-weight:bold;&#x0027;><em>perfecting</em></span> this thing called Dr. Schulze.
</p><p>
To me, the primary thing I want in great abundance in my life is Health. After all, without health it is hard to create my big list of desires, which are lots of Fun, Laughter, Happiness, Love, Passion, Gusto, and even more Fun. And besides my passionate love for living my life, I like to share my experiences with you, in my ever-continuing effort to Create Powerful Health and my crusade to preach the Gospel of Natural Healing and Herbal Medicine. 
</p><p>
So, the following are a few healthy tips for you to consider at the beginning of this new Fall season, so you can join me in creating a successful finish to 2008 and creating an even more wonderful life in 2009.
</p><p>
FOOD. Eat more root vegetables like potatoes, beets, carrots etc., and start including more grains, nuts and seeds into your food program. As the weather turns colder you will need to consume more calories. Remember, when trying to discover what foods are seasonal, and therefore natural for you to eat this time of year, visit your local organic farmer&#x0027;s market, and talk to the farmers. You will know immediately what is right for you to eat.
</p><p>
ELIMINATION. Well. I often suggest that Fall as a great time to do a Kidney Detox, but any of my 5-Day Detox programs will do. First, it is very important to do a 5-Day Detox with every seasonal change. This time of year, a detox will help your body prepare for the cooler weather changes ahead, and get you ready and <em>boost your immune system</em>, for the Fall and coming Winter. When in doubt, or if you haven&#x0027;t done a detox in awhile, always start with my 5-Day BOWEL Detox.
</p><p>
MOVEMENT. This is a great time of the year for power walks and running outside, to enjoy all of the sights and smells of nature, and the robust, fresh air. Dress a little warmer, wear layers, and get out there and sweat. Also, remember to not be afraid to get wet. In fact, enjoy getting soaked once in a while, just don&#x0027;t get too chilled. Remember your flexibility too, because when it gets colder, your muscles will take a little longer to warm up, so be patient. As it gets colder, spend twice as much time with your warm up movements.
</p><p>
EMOTIONAL. Fall is a great time to check in with yourself and see what you have accomplished this year, because the year is three-fourths over, you are in the final stretch. So if you have not gotten what you wanted to create this year by now, GET FOCUSED, let&#x0027;s go, there is no time like the present to get on them and get your butt and your buts out of the way and just do it. While you are at it, check your house for any accumulated stuff that you have unconsciously acquired during this year <em>and get rid of it</em>. I like Spring Cleaning and Fall Trashing, so lighten the load.
</p><p>
Also, there is no time like now to start working on creating better self-esteem. You don&#x0027;t want to go into the holidays insecure and depressed, so do what you have to do <span style=&#x0027;font-weight:bold;&#x0027;>RIGHT NOW</span> to feel great about yourself. Nothing will raise your self-esteem higher and faster than a great detox program, eating healthier and increasing your body movement, which will lift your spirits and make you feel better, more alive and have more energy, AND feel a whole lot better about yourself.
</p><p>
SPIRITUAL. Well, the most spiritual time of the year for most people is just around the corner. Let&#x0027;s make this year the best year of your life when it comes to Fun, Laughter, Joy, Happiness, Peace, Love and Bliss. IT&#x0027;S NOT TOO LATE! Let&#x0027;s not just use these words on our holiday cards. Let&#x0027;s give them some real meaning in our life by bringing these words into action.
</p><p>
Let&#x0027;s make this year end-up the most loving and happy year of your life, with your friends, your family and YOURSELF. You have three months left, so the time to get healthy-physically, emotionally and spiritually-is RIGHT NOW! See you there.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last 48 hours I have received hundreds of questions from customers all across America, about the potential radiation exposure from the Japanese Nuclear Power Plant disaster.

The questions are ranging from taking prophylactic potassium iodide (KI) to general and natural radiation protection.

First I would like to say that I had many students in the vicinity of Chernobyl during their nuclear facility meltdown, and worked with them to protect and treat their patients. So I do have a lot of helpful information and experience - lets get started!

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How much Radiation is coming?</span></strong>

I think that one thing we know for sure, is that we cannot trust the power companies, nor the Japanese or the American governments, when it comes to getting us accurate information and possibly even telling the truth. The media and the Internet may be our best and more accurate source of current information.

As far as the Japanese nuclear energy suppliers, we know they are total liars. Their nuclear power plant executives have been arrested in the past for falsifying nuclear facility safety and incident reports, to the point where the Japanese government has closed every Japanese nuclear power plant at one time or another. And the American government has made many mistakes in the past monitoring facilities, and reporting incidents such as this, and even downplaying disasters to avoid panic, and has even been found to have “outright lied” on other occasions. So while private businesses and government agencies alike are known to falsify, cover up information and even lie, I would say that I do NOT trust anyone giving this current information.

Again, I would seek out the Internet, and try to find your own truth, which probably lies somewhere between the hysterical panic of the doomsayers and the lies of the Japanese corporate executives.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Radioactive Fallout?</span></strong>

Radioactive fallout is like radioactive dust. After the radioactive explosions, radioactive particles attach to dirt and dust, and circulate into the air, and in this instance, have been carried by the jet stream winds from Japan to America. The simple reason it is called fallout is because this type of dust literally falls out of the sky onto us. Within a few weeks, winds will carry this fallout to almost all areas of the planet. If you suspect that radioactive fallout has reached harmful levels, you should consider ALL of the following.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are two major ways that this Fallout contaminates us, External and Internal. </span></strong>

<strong>#1     To protect from EXTERNAL Contamination, Stay Inside, Breath Clean Air and Cover Up.</strong>

One of the best ways to protect yourself from radioactive fallout dust or contamination is simply to<strong> stay indoors. Keep the windows and doors closed</strong> and avoid direct contamination of this “dust” to your body. In extreme circumstances, you can even temporarily seal the house with plastic sheeting and duct tape, especially if a concentrated radioactive cloud was passing through.

If you are outdoors, <strong>cover your head and hair, wear a scarf or dust mask over your mouth, and cover up with clothing as much as possible.</strong> Then as soon as possible, remove all of these clothes, and scrub your skin with soap, water and a skin brush. If exposure is extreme, cutting your hair off is also advised.

<strong>#2     To protect from INTERNAL Contamination, Watch what you Breathe, Eat and Drink.</strong>

Internal contamination comes from breathing air, and ingesting food and drink that has been contaminated with this radioactive dust.

As far as breathing in radioactive dust, you must protect yourself by <strong>breathing through a dust mask or dust filtration mask, or at least a scarf.</strong>

As far as food, one thing we have learned from past nuclear incidents, is that the number one food that has always been accountable for 98% of radiation dust consumption, is milk and dairy products. <strong>So DO NOT consume any milk or dairy products.</strong> Only about 2% of radioactive dust ingestion has come from all other sources of food. This is because milk and dairy products have proven to have the highest concentrations of radioactive contamination after fallout has occurred.

Having said that, it is extremely important to wash all of your fruits and vegetables, even organically grown, because any food can be exposed to this radioactive dust. <strong>So washing all food with soap, water and a scrub brush is extremely important.</strong> This will remove the radioactive dust.

<strong>Finally, make sure that any water that you consume is bottled,</strong> (before the fallout occurred) <strong>or purified.</strong> Having a great water filter around is perfect for this type of emergency.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Should I take Potassium Iodide (KI)?</span></strong>

<strong>Unless high-level exposure is imminent, assumed or confirmed, I would NOT flood my body with this.</strong>

Since your thyroid assimilates iodine as food in order to function, and manufacture your thyroid hormones, and since this radioactive fallout is partially iodine131, your thyroid will gobble up this radioactive iodine. This is a very bad thing to happen.

The idea is that if you flood your body with non-radioactive iodine, and your thyroid is full, it won’t take in any more iodine, including the radioactive iodine from the fallout, and it will hopefully pass through your body harmlessly and be eliminated. And one of the ways to flood your body with iodine is by using Potassium Iodide (KI), as taking high levels of iodine is NOT advised and can be poisonous, even lethal.

All your questions about this can be answered at <a style="color: blue;" href="http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/ki.asp"> http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/ki.asp</a> which is the Center for Disease Control website, which includes dosages and just about everything you would want to know about this treatment.

Again, I would NOT consume this unless high-level exposure is imminent, assumed or confirmed.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Are there Natural ways to do this instead of Potassium Iodide?</span></strong>

Yes!

Many herbs are rich sources of iodine, especially seaweeds. Although most people think that Kelp is the highest food and plant source of iodine, actually Dulse has twice as much iodine as Kelp, along with every mineral known, as it grows in the ocean. This is why I use Purple Dulse as one of my ingredients in SuperFood Plus. And although a normal serving of these foods contains extremely high amounts of iodine, it is still about 300 times less than the massive dose of potassium iodide that is used to flood and saturate your thyroid with iodine.

So while some researchers think that using the natural source seaweeds, because of the much lower amount of iodine, would not be effective, other researchers feel that the iodine in the sea vegetables is much more bio-available and will assimilate easier, therefore it will be more effective, so a lower dose may be effective to block the absorption of radioactive iodine.

Also I must state that there has been no substantial testing that I have ever seen using lower doses of herbal and organic natural food source iodine such as Dulse, instead of taking the potassium iodide, for the prevention of the toxic absorption of radioactive iodine131.

Now while some non-herbal people might be scoffing at the idea of loading your body up with SuperFood Plus, or running to the health food store and loading up on Dulse and Kelp, and thinking that this lower dose may not be effective, listen up.

During the Chernobyl nuclear power plant meltdown, I had students that didn’t have any potassium iodide available in their clinics, so instead they painted parts of their patients body’s with iodine tincture, some even with my black walnut and dulse tinctures that are high in iodine. And low and behold, their bodies assimilated the iodine through the skin, and their thyroid was protected. In fact these people ended up having the exact same low levels of radioactive uptake into their thyroid as the group that took potassium iodide. In fact after this incident, I have seen other studies that prove that painting iodine tincture onto a small areas of your body, like the hand or kneecap, (some even as small as a silver dollar) was equal to taking potassium iodide, in blocking radioactive dust uptake by your thyroid.

So now people are not laughing at the SuperFood, Dulse and Kelp idea anymore, and certainly all of these are better than doing nothing.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What other Natural Preventative Measures should you Consider?</span></strong>

After the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II, it was determined that there was a direct correlation between A) the amount of radioactive fallout poisoning exposure, and B) the frequency that the person had a bowel movement, and C) the degree of radiation sickness that a person developed. The reason for this is simple. When you consume food that has radioactive fallout contamination, and this food sits in your body and bowel for days, or a week, well this gives you much greater exposure time to the radioactive fallout, and therefore the radiation does significantly more damage. On the contrary, if your bowel is eliminating 2 or 3 times a day, this gives you much less exposure time to the radioactive fallout. So this is simply why keeping your bowels active, keeps flushing out the radioactive dust and does not let it build up inside your body.

Secondly, after the Chernobyl power plant nuclear meltdown, apple pectin was used extensively to extract radiation from people’s bodies and their bowels, as it is proven to remove heavy metals including radioactive fallout and particles, even Strontium 90. This action proved to significantly prevent damage and disease that would have been caused by the radiation exposure and contamination.

So on the first assumption that you may have eaten contaminated food, and have consumed radioactive fallout, I would immediately use my <strong>Bowel Flush “SHOT”</strong>, and then consider doing my complete <strong>5-Day Bowel Detox Program</strong>, that has <strong>Intestinal Formula #1</strong>, which would continue to stimulate the bowels to make sure that no radioactive dust had time to stay inside your bowel to cause any poisoning or damage. This Detox program also contains the <strong>Intestinal Formula #2</strong> which contains <strong>apple pectin</strong>, that draws out the radioactive dust, and also the <strong>bentonite clay</strong> that will physically pull out the radioactive dust.

<strong>For all of these reasons, a good bowel Detox is the antidote for internal consumption of contaminated radioactive food.</strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My 10 Step Prevention / Protection Program</span></strong>

<strong>Stay Inside, Keep Doors and Windows Shut</strong>

<strong>Wear a Dust Mask</strong>

<strong>Remove Contaminated Clothing Immediately</strong>

<strong>Wash with Soap, Water and a Skin Brush</strong>

<strong>DO NOT consume any Milk or Dairy Products</strong>

<strong>Wash all Fruits, Vegetables or any Contaminated Food with Soap, Water and a Scrub Brush</strong>

<strong>Drink only Purified water.</strong>

<strong>Unless high-level exposure is imminent, assumed or confirmed, DO NOT take Potassium Iodide</strong>

<strong>Do flood your body with Dulse, Kelp and SuperFood Plus, and consider painting parts of your body with Iodine solutions or tinctures.</strong>

<strong>If you suspect any Internal Contamination, flush your bowel immediately with my Bowel Flush “SHOT” and then follow up by doing my complete 5-Day Bowel Detox Program</strong>

<strong>Finally</strong>, in this first week of my BLOG, I have interrupted my planned normal schedule of answering your questions with this ALERT, but the volume of your concerns and questions demanded it. After all, this is what this BLOG is all about, current answers and information, and YOU!

On a positive note, this incident in Japan, and the previous ones in Russia and the United States, are simply costly lessons, that nuclear energy, is not the safe long term option that many people would have us believe. I hope that this incident will put us all on a faster track to develop alternate, safe, natural and healthy power for our children.

Peace

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have always said that if I am ever unfortunate enough to be run over by a train, and my torso is on one side of the tracks and my legs are on the other, that I would like to have a CT scan, an MRI and a top team of surgeons put me all back together ASAP.

But, barring some major catastrophe, and trauma medicine, I have always said that most people are better off avoiding most medical care all together, especially when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

I remember reading a study a few years back (to most all oncologist’s dismay) that in spite of all of the amazing claims of advancements and cures, the average person with cancer, would live longer, if they simply did <strong>nothing at all</strong>, outliving those that choose aggressive medical therapy. That’s right, if they do nothing at all they actually live longer! In fact, the study went on to say that they would have a much better quality of life too, be a lot less tortured, not to mention save hundreds of thousands of dollars and avoid giving their house and entire nest egg to doctors, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals.

Back to <strong>CT scans…</strong> The cat is now out of the bag, <em>pun intended</em>. According to the most recent evidence, many CT Scans are NOT necessary, and that is according to Dr. Rita F. Redburg, editor of the <em>Archives of Internal Medicine</em>.

In 2007 (the most recent data), it was estimated that <strong>29,000 Americans will develop Cancer because they got a CT scan, and that more than 15,000 will die from Cancer due to CT scans!</strong>

<strong>This means that CT scans are now one of the highest causes of cancer and DEATH!</strong> Doesn’t anyone but me think this is insane?!

A while ago I got a call from an old friend, his wife was in severe abdominal pain and distress and he called me asking for advice. After asking a few questions, I suggested that it was probably trapped gas, and suggested one of my <strong>Digestive “SHOTS”</strong>, which is a powerful carminative that offers strong help for indigestion, heartburn, acid reflux, <strong>gas</strong>, nausea, etc. He said she was scared, but I even suggested a hot water bottle over the lower abdomen, a few teaspoons of my <strong>Intestinal Formula #2</strong> in 16-ounces of water, doing some easy stretches, even an enema, at which point he sounded like I was going way too far, so I didn’t mention putting his finger in her anus and stimulating it.

Regardless of my advice, he rushed her to the hospital emergency room late at night. They waited a few hours to be seen while she was in agonizing pain (as they didn’t take my herbal advice) and then finally the medical doctor suggested a CT scan and they agreed. They called me from the hospital and asked me again, and told me the medical doctors wanted to do a CT scan and had already taken blood and were already injecting chemicals, and I repeated, <em><strong>“Get out of there! It is probably just gas!”</strong></em> I also mentioned to them that a CT scan was dangerous and was equal to <strong>hundreds</strong> of x-rays in radiation exposure and at this point I could see I lost them, like I was out of my mind.

Anyway, they took more blood, injected more chemicals, did a CT scan and after six hours found nothing, and told her to go home, <em>and that it was probably… just gas.</em>

What they didn’t tell them was the bill that was coming in the mail in a week would be for over $8,000.00 and also that <strong>the CT scan they gave her was actually equal in radioactive exposure to 442 chest x-rays!</strong>

They called me a few days later and said they felt real stupid. Hey, we all do stupid things, I just hope she isn’t one of the over 50,000 that will get cancer this year because of an unnecessary CT scan.

So I will REPEAT:

In 2007, the most recent medical data on this subject, it is estimated that <strong>29,000 Americans will develop Cancer because they got a CT scan, and that more than 15,000 will die from Cancer due to CT scans!</strong>

<strong>This means that CT scans are now one of the leading causes of cancer and DEATH!</strong> Doesn’t anyone but me think this is insane?!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>Lower Your Cholesterol Naturally to 150 or Below, with NO DRUGS…</strong></span>

<i><strong>I get literally hundreds of questions from people who have recently returned from a medical doctor check-up to discover that they have high cholesterol. Some also have high LDLs and even VLDLs and Triglycerides. Others were even told that they have too low cholesterol. I will address all of these in my answer.</strong>

<strong>Below are just two of these hundreds of questions—one from a woman who is 68 and another from a man who is 35—both with high cholesterol. </strong>

<strong>After their questions, I will explain all about cholesterol and more important, I will explain my Clinical Cholesterol Reduction Program. No matter who you are, no matter what your age, and no matter how high your cholesterol level, if you want to maintain a healthy low cholesterol level, and do it naturally, without drugs, your answer is here…</strong></i>

<i><span style="color: red;">Dear Dr. Schulze,
I recently had a blood test and it showed high cholesterol and LDL levels. What products of yours would you recommend to help reduce both those levels along with a better diet and exercise? I am 68 and have never had a problem with LDL levels. Cholesterol has always been around 200. Thanks for your info! 
— Jean P. in Punta Gorda, FL</span></i>

<i><span style="color: red;">Dear Dr. Schulze,
I am 35-years-old and recently I had my annual physical and my doctor told me my cholesterol was high. Not sure what I am doing wrong for it to be high (triglycerides were fine). Of course, he wants to put me on cholesterol lowering medication, which I DO NOT want to do. What can I do to lower my cholesterol and keep it down at a healthy level, provided there is such a thing?  I have read that cholesterol levels can rise when the liver/gallbladder are stressed and it’s a response your body reacts to... Is that the case or am I totally wrong? 
— Jorge V. in Alexandria, VA</span></i>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>What is Cholesterol?</strong></span>

The word literally translated from the Greek means “solid bile”. It is a waxy-like fat that circulates in our blood. It comes from two sources:

<strong>Source #1</strong> is that  <strong>we manufacture cholesterol</strong>, in our liver and then it is turned into bile, which we need to digest food, like fats, and also fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D and E. Cholesterol is also important for our body to manufacture hormones, even estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. It is an important fat for the human body and circulates in our blood, and excess cholesterol is stored in our gallbladder.

<strong>Source #2</strong>, the other source of <strong>cholesterol is dietary</strong>, it is in the food that we eat. Cholesterol is found in ALL animal foods, their flesh, eggs, milk, and all animal by-products including fish and seafood. There is absolutely NO CHOLESTEROL in any fruit, vegetable, grain, seed, nut or sprout. Cholesterol is only found in animal food.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>How is Cholesterol measured?</strong></span>

Cholesterol is measured by taking a sample of your blood and then calculating the amount of cholesterol that is in it. This measurement is how many milligrams of cholesterol (mg) that are found in a deciliter (d/L) (1/10 of a liter) of blood. It is written like this, 150mg/dL.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>What is a healthy Cholesterol level?</strong></span>

In America, by almost all medical groups, associations and medical experts—including the Mayo Clinic—it is considered <strong>normal, healthy and desirable</strong> to have a blood cholesterol level of 200 milligrams of cholesterol per deciliter of blood, written 200mg/dL. It is considered <em>borderline,</em> to have a cholesterol level between 201 and 239, and it is considered <em>high</em> to have a blood cholesterol level at 240 and above.

A high blood level of cholesterol is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks and stroke.

<strong>Important Note: </strong>I think it is very important to note right here that while medical experts consider a blood cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL to be <em>normal</em>, unfortunately what is also normal in America is cardiovascular disease, heart attacks and strokes. <strong>In fact, in America, we have the highest incidence of coronary artery blockage, coronary artery disease, heart attacks and stroke in the entire world,</strong> <strong>and almost all of this disease is directly related to cholesterol blocking arterial blood flow.</strong> I think it is also very important to note that the average cholesterol level in China is 122, much lower than in America, where they have a significantly and dramatically lower incidence of these same circulatory diseases. There is no doubt that the lower the cholesterol level in the general population of China, and the lower incidence of heart disease and stroke, is totally related. Considering this fact, while the medical experts in America say 200 is normal, it is also normal that the #1 cause of death in America today is heart attacks and stroke. I think these facts alone underscore the importance that the medical establishment in America take another look at what they consider <em>normal</em>, and recognize that what they consider <em>normal</em> is the major contributing factor to the #1 cause of death!

Another important fact here is that the Chinese on average consume one pound of animal meat a week per family of four. That is only two ounces a day or a half-ounce a day per person, so they mainly have a rice and vegetable food program, with very little animal.

Along with the Chinese, the average Vegetarian in America has a blood Cholesterol level below 130 and rarely dies from cardiovascular disease where one-third of all American meat eaters will die from cardiovascular diseases.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>Can your Liver produce too much Cholesterol?</strong></span>

YES, and this can be a contributing factor to high cholesterol levels in the blood. But having said that, in my clinic I NEVER had a patient that followed my program and couldn’t reduce their blood cholesterol levels to below 160, regardless of how much cholesterol their body produced.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>What are Triglycerides, HDLs, LDLs and VLDLs?</strong></span>

<strong>Triglycerides</strong>
Triglycerides are fats that exist in your blood, very similar to cholesterol and they exist with cholesterol in your blood plasma. They come from fat in the food that you eat, and like cholesterol, are also manufactured in your body.

When you consume food, and eat more calories than you need, triglycerides are stored with fat cells to be used later when you need energy. Unfortunately, because most people eat too much fat and carbohydrates, and do not get enough exercise, they store too many triglycerides.

High triglyceride levels in your blood (again, like cholesterol) is linked to cardiovascular and coronary artery disease.

Similar to cholesterol numbers, high and potentially dangerous are triglyceride levels above 200 and below 150 is considered normal. Personally I prefer triglyceride levels to be even lower.

<strong>HDLs, LDLs and VLDLs</strong>
Your total cholesterol level is a combination of all of your lipoproteins (HDLs + LDLs + VLDLs + a few more fatty substances). As the name suggests, lipoproteins are a combination of lipo (fat) and protein.

Lipoproteins have a very important function in your body, as they transport fats around in your blood. All the cells in your body need fats, cholesterol and triglycerides as food to build their cell membranes, the structure of the cell. It is the lipoproteins that transport cholesterol and fat from your liver, through your blood to all of your body’s cells, and then back to your liver.

Since fat and water don’t mix (like olive oil and water) and since your blood is more like water, the lipoproteins encase fats and transport them through your blood.

<strong>HDLs are High density Lipoproteins</strong>, and they basically pick up cholesterol from your body, blood vessels and blood and bring it back to your liver, where it can be eliminated via your gallbladder and bowel. HDLs are often called the “Good Cholesterol” as they can literally lower your cholesterol level by removing it from your body.

A level of HDLs in your blood greater than 60mg/dL is considered optimal and healthy, while a level below 40mg/dL is considered dangerous increasing your risk of arterial plaque and heart and circulatory disease.

Recent studies over the past few decades have even shown that high levels of HDLs can literally scrub and clean cholesterol and plaque off the walls of arteries that are already blocked. YES, your body will heal and repair itself if you give it a fighting chance!

<strong>LDLs are Low Density Lipoproteins, </strong>and they do the exact opposite of HDLs. They collect cholesterol from your liver and take it out through your blood to all the cells of your body. Although they are very necessary, too many LDLs transport too much fat through blood vessels and the body, which is not healthy and therefore they are often referred to as “Bad Cholesterol”.

Medical authorities suggest that a safe level of LDLs is less than 100 mg/dL, and this is considered healthy and optimal for LDL cholesterol. Personally, I would like to see my patients below 70mg/dL.

<strong>VLDLs are Very Low Density Lipoproteins</strong>, and they transport triglycerides through the blood to cells and fat in the body. These are also considered “Bad Cholesterol” as they transport cholesterol into your body and cells.

The bottom line is that all of these lipoproteins are necessary to be healthy, but the balance or ratio of them in your blood is what is important.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>What is the HDL / LDL Cholesterol ratio?</strong></span>

Many doctors look at the ratio between HDL and LDL cholesterol, along with looking at the total cholesterol level, to determine the risk of coronary artery and cardiovascular disease. This ratio of HDL/LDL looks at the ratio of the HDL “good” cholesterol to the LDL “bad” cholesterol.

To deduce this ratio, divide your HDL cholesterol by your LDL cholesterol.

For example, if you have an HDL cholesterol level of 60 mg/dL and your LDL cholesterol level is 100mg/dL, then your HDL/LDL ratio would be 0.6. Most medical doctors think any ratio above 0.3 is good but I would like to see it above 0.4, or even higher.<strong> </strong>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>How can I raise my levels of HDLs and lower my LDLs and VLDLs?</strong></span>

I knew you would ask this question, which takes me right to…

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>What is the most effective program to reduce Cholesterol levels?</strong></span>

<strong>Dr. Schulze's Clinical Cholesterol Reduction Program</strong>

<strong>Food</strong>
I am a doctor, and if the #1 cause of death in America, which would also be the #1 cause of death for my patients, is high cholesterol blocking the arteries to the heart, brain and other organs, killing them and killing you, well, I guess being a responsible doctor, it only makes sense that I would check my patients’ blood cholesterol levels and get them down to a safe level. (Not what medical doctors think is normal, but what the disease statistics dictate is normal.)

This is just one of the many reasons that in my clinic, why all three of my Clinical Food Programs were Vegetarian food programs. (Click on my book Detoxification Volume 1, on the right margin of this BLOG site, and you will see all three of these food programs, what they are and when to use them, all described in detail, within this book.)

If the #1 cause of death in America is cholesterol, then it is also the #1 cause of death for my patients, so I better do something about this, and the best thing I can think of is a food program that does NOT contain any cholesterol.

As I said, all of my Clinical Food Programs are Vegetarian. To me, being a vegetarian means absolutely no animal food, flesh, blood, eggs, milk—NONE. Now today in America, it can mean a wide variety of things, and because it is cool in some circles to say you are a vegetarian, I find there are many different meanings to this word, like fish and chicken eating vegetarians, to lacto-ovo (dairy and egg) eating vegetarians, so to be painfully specific here, I guess I mean what today we refer to as Vegan. Again, read my description in the book of my three food programs and you will understand exactly what I mean.

Now having said all of that, I realize that nobody ever dropped dead from eating one cheeseburger and a milk shake. But I am a doctor, and we are talking about a food program to bring dangerously high cholesterol levels down to safe low cholesterol levels. And, I would be lying if I said you could do this without drugs, <em>and still consume cholesterol, </em>you cannot, so stop eating it.

Whether you are trying to lower your cholesterol levels, or heal yourself of any disease, ANY disease, stopping eating ALL animals and their byproducts is a fundamental principal of Natural Healing. Once you have normal cholesterol levels and/or are disease-free, then I won’t watch what you put in your mouth on a Saturday night, but until then, stick to the program.

Another tip, if you are concerned about getting enough nutrition, please read Chapters 2, 3, and 4 of my “20 Powerful Steps” book, which is also available to read FREE, right on this BLOG. You might also consider taking my <strong>SuperFood Plus</strong> every day too, and it contains a lot of nutrition, and ZERO cholesterol.

<strong>Herbal</strong>
Cholesterol is also manufactured in your intestines, but regardless, my first detox is always my <strong>5-Day BOWEL Detox</strong>. You must make sure that your bowel is clean and functioning well <em>before</em> you consider doing any other detoxification. This is simply because all solid waste, even old bile and gallstones (cholesterol) from your liver and gallbladder are eventually emptied into your intestines and bowel for elimination. If your bowel is sluggish, congested or constipated, you cannot effectively clean out your body. So get the bowel clean, toned and healthy FIRST!

Then, it is time to do my <strong>5-Day LIVER Detox</strong>, which includes my Liver and Gallbladder Flush. This detox is basically a laxative for the liver and gallbladder, cleaning it out and purging it of its contents, including cholesterol. And, it also tones and strengthens your liver and gallbladder and gets them healthier. The herbs are also powerful liver protectors, and protect your liver cells from the constant chemical bombardment we call “living the American Dream”.

Once your liver and gallbladder are clean, you may also consider my <strong>PROTECT Formula</strong> for the rest of your life, to keep that liver protected. You can read up about that formula on my Herbal Medicine website by clicking here: <a href="http://www.herbdoc.com/">http://www.herbdoc.com</a>

<strong>Garlic</strong>
Garlic is famous for its ability to reduce cholesterol levels, so much so it is used medically for this purpose in many countries around the world. I would have my patients consume three cloves a day, (one clove, three times a day) raw or chopped. Have it either swallowed or mixed into cooked food, but don’t cook the garlic, just mix it in your food. And forget about garlic pills—just eat it RAW!

<strong>Exercise / Movement</strong>
A regular exercise program, even an hour of brisk walking a day, kept up daily for a month or two, has been proven to reduce your cholesterol level by up to 30%, so let’s get moving.

Remember, especially with moving, fun is FUNdamental. If you do not make moving fun, you will quit moving, so make it FUN! I highly suggest you go to my “Links” page in the upper Navigation Bar of this BLOG, and the third link down is my movement Guru, ZenKahuna. Check out many of his fun ways to get moving more, while having lots of fun doing it. He breaks all the rules.

<strong>Stress</strong>
Stress makes you sick, and can even raise cholesterol levels and make it harder for you to get rid of it, so let’s start to melt the stress away. Slow down a bit, time is a man-made nightmare. Move more, breathe deeper, and see how you can eliminate things from your life that take up your time and cause stress. A month ago, I realized I had been run over by the information highway, and the safest thing I could do was get off the road. So, I stopped emailing and closed my email account. This immediately gave me more time to get healthy and lowered my stress.

<strong>Finally</strong>
My patients who followed this program for three months, ALL dropped their cholesterol levels to absolutely normal, their triglycerides too, and lowered their LDLs and VLDLs and raised their HDLs. And, I had patients with some of the highest cholesterol levels that medical doctors have ever heard of.

While on this program, most of my patients had normal cholesterol levels in only one month, and great HDL / LDL ratios, but why stop the fun after only one month?

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>How do you know for sure these programs work?</strong></span>

Read the following letter…

<em>“18 months ago my cholesterol was 1469, almost 1500, my triglycerides reached 8664, almost 9000! It was really scary. My head felt like the top of it could just explode, and my brain even felt like it was shaking, along with the rest of my body. I had to resort to nerve medication, and I tried the drugs to lower cholesterol, but found it was damaging my liver. I was hospitalized three times with pancreatitis, and I had another four attacks after, but just stayed home and survived. The hospital stays were complete nightmares. No one I have ever talked to, no doctor or lab worker, had ever heard of someone with cholesterol and triglyceride levels so HIGH and still be ALIVE.</em>

<em>I did your 5-Day LIVER Detox five weeks in a row, as well as the whole Incurables Program. I passed two tumors with ‘tentacles’ and hundreds of small green stones. After a year on the programs, my cholesterol is now 158 and my triglycerides are down to 444! I thank God for the information arriving when it did! May God bless you and guide you in your adventure! If I could do it, I know you can do it too!! My prayers are with you. Love in Christ.”</em>

<em> — J.K. in Mound City, MO</em>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>Should I use the Heart Tonic?</strong></span>

YES! Anyone who has or has had a high cholesterol level should be using the <strong>Heart Tonic</strong>. The <strong>Heart Tonic</strong>, besides being a tonic for your entire Cardiovascular and Circulatory System, PROTECTS your heart, and lets it function on less blood and oxygen if your arteries are already blocked or your blood is thick with fat and cholesterol. I would use this formula daily, for at least three months, until all of your numbers are perfect.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>If my Arteries are Already Blocked with Cholesterol and Fat, can I Remove this Blockage Naturally?</strong></span>

YES! Dr. Dean Ornish, one of the nation’s leading vegetarian cardiologists, has done numerous studies proving that you can stop, and even reverse coronary artery plaque and cholesterol build-up, and remove it by living a healthy lifestyle. My Clinical Cholesterol Reduction Program is a few steps beyond what Dr. Ornish did to achieve these results. Remember…

Your body can and will heal itself of ANYTHING, ANY DISEASE. Just STOP doing what you did that made you sick And START doing what will Create Powerful Health! And dis-ease will disappear!

See my description of this action above under HDLs.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>My Medical Doctor says my arteries are blocked with calcium plaque, not cholesterol.</strong></span>

This is a misconception. FIRST, excess cholesterol was deposited and got stuck onto the walls of your arteries. Then, white blood cells attached to it causing inflammation. Finally, it was covered with calcium plaque and became a type of scar tissue on the inside of your arteries, causing a reduction in blood flow. If this is in your coronary or cerebral arteries it can cause a heart attack or stroke. So, this top layer or “crust” of this plaque may indeed be calcium, but underneath it is cholesterol and was caused by high cholesterol levels or what is referred to as hypercholesterolemia.

Regardless of what your arteries are blocked with, your new, healthy lifestyle will remove it and clear your arteries.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>Do you ever advise Cholesterol Lowering Medications?</strong></span>

NO. NEVER!

FIRST, I say this simply because I have NEVER found them to be necessary. I have had the most extreme cases of high cholesterol ALWAYS respond to my Natural Healing program. Every patient with high cholesterol was able to bring their cholesterol levels down to normal and BELOW, by just following my program.

SECOND, ALL DRUGS are dangerous and have health-damaging side effects, especially cholesterol lowering drugs. So, I suggest you avoid them at all cost.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>My Medical Doctor says my Cholesterol level is too low and that I should eat more meat. What do you think?</strong></span>

Your MD is an IDIOT! I have heard many patients over the years tell me this exact same thing. That they went in for a regular check-up, and their medical doctor said their blood cholesterol was 130 mg/dL or 120 mg/dL and that is <em>dangerously</em> low. What utter bull! I have had many patients that were told by their MD to eat more red meat and cheese to raise their cholesterol. The stupidity of some doctors never ceases to amaze me.

I have NEVER read, or heard of ANYONE (and I have researched this) who was ill because their cholesterol level was <em>too low. </em>On the other hand, millions are dying because their cholesterol levels are too high! So, unless these MDs were trying to make their patients sick, give them high blood pressure or a heart attack or stroke, I go back to my original statement that they are simply being ignorant idiots.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>The Bottom Line!</strong></span>

I will say it again… Every patient I ever had—no matter how fat, no matter how high their cholesterol and triglyceride levels were, no matter how out-of-whack their HDL / LDL ratio was—ALL OF THEM were able to return to normal blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels and ratios on this program, PERIOD!

<p><strong>A Note From <span class"nowrap">Dr. Schulze:</strong><br></p>
<p>Friends, as you know my clinics were in Hollywood and Malibu, California and at one time or another I worked with almost every famous Hollywood star, director, producer, etc. I never talk about them personally—NEVER—but occasionally some of them talk about me!</p>
<p>You know me, I am very focused on Natural Healing and Herbal Medicine but... at the same time I recognize that millions and millions of people read celebrity, star and fashion magazines and want to know what the stars are up to. So, I thought that from time to time I would post a few of these <span class="nowrap">Dr. Schulze</span>/Star stories that make the news, in case you missed them.</p>
<p>I know, I know, many of you very serious health crusaders, like me, would rather hear about my routines for gallstones or cancer than what the stars are doing but... you also have friends and relatives that don't (or won't) take my herbal medicine just because you do, or even when you tell them to. Over the years I have found that they might take my medicine once they discover that Tom Cruise, Sting, Madonna, Steven Seagal or the President does, so it never hurts to release a few of these stories.</p>
<p>Remember, I am a diehard Natural Healing and Herbal Medicine evangelist and I will stop at nothing to try and get you—and your relatives and friends—to heal yourselves naturally, so that is why I do what I do!</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
<p>— Dr. Schulze</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Friends, the following is an answer to a question from a customer, but it is such an important issue—and a question that I get asked by many of you EVERY WEEK—that I took a little more time on it and turned it into a valuable lesson for all of you. I hope this helps many of you make this very important decision. <br><br> — Dr. Schulze</strong>

<br><strong>QUESTION</strong>

<i><span style="color: red;">Dear Dr. Schulze,

I am a huge fan of yours and I now have my entire family on all of your products, and I am blessed to tell you that everyone in my family is healthy now. The many complaints that used to cause us to go to the doctor are now gone. No one in my family has been to the doctor in over three years. We haven’t even had any colds thanks to your Cold &amp; Flu SHOT. It feels so great, and so empowering, to be both Mom and also my family’s doctor. The kids even say our new hospital emergency room is the house kitchen (thanks to your First Aid DVD). God Bless you.

I am writing you, as I know that you are totally against using any chemical and pharmaceutical drugs and medicines. My question is - is there ever an exception to this rule? I am asking this because my father has lived a healthy life (he is 84 years young) and recently his medical doctors say he needs some heart medicine to stay alive. They say it will give him more years and I just wanted to get your opinion on this, although I already think I know what you will say. But obviously I want to see my Dad live as long as possible.

So I am awaiting your response. Thanks again for your wonderful, herbal and NATURAL medicine.

— Patty E. in Hollywood, FL</span></i>

<strong>ANSWER</strong>

Dear Patty,

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>FIRST, and VERY IMPORTANT</strong></span>
All of my knowledge, all of my knowing, all of my understanding, comes from my clinical experience. It is important that you know this, and that the following is NOT just my opinion, or that I am trying to just prove some Natural Healing or herbal medicine point. Instead, this is my ACTUAL EXPERIENCE, time and time again, with tens of thousands of patients. Additionally, it is also the ACTUAL EXPERIENCE of my great teachers, from their clinics, with tens of thousands of their patients. The reason I emphasize this is very important. <strong>You are putting your trust and your LIFE in my hands, and I take this VERY SERIOUSLY.</strong>

So, I am not going to do any guessing here, or any preaching about Natural Healing and herbal medicine, or give you any of my opinions, theories and hypotheses, and I have many of these. I am simply going to tell you the absolute truth, what I witnessed firsthand in my clinic for decades using Natural Healing routines and my herbal medicine to treat disease, PERIOD!

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>My Clinical Observation and Experience</strong></span>
<strong>Most people are lazy.</strong> Maybe this is human nature. Maybe this is why the biggest health epidemic in America today is obesity. But whatever the reason, most people I meet are lazy. I would safely say this is about 90% of the people I meet. They are lazy. This is a big reason why medical doctors, drugs and hospitals have become such big, profitable businesses in America today, because rarely are we asked to (or even want to) take any responsibility in our own healing.

A simple example of this is, how many times have we seen a man get a coronary bypass surgery, and have his clogged or blocked arteries replaced, only to be out eating cheeseburgers, French fries and milk shakes a week after his surgery at some fast food restaurant (if not right in the hospital) clogging up the new blood vessels?

NO Responsibility.

Modern medicine—almost all of it—is designed for lazy people who are too damn lazy to create a healthy lifestyle, too lazy to eat healthy, nutritious food, too lazy to do routine cleansing and detoxification, too lazy to move their ass every day and too damn lazy to be positive and loving to themselves and others.

From the drive-through at fast food garbage houses, to microwaving manufactured fast food at home, to the lazy boy chair, to the mind-rotting television, sitting down and taking as many breaks as possible, just to get back to the fast food and do it all over again.

<strong>Patty, getting well is pretty darn easy. For most of my patients, it was simply a matter of STOPPING what was making them sick.</strong>

But most people, instead of stopping eating food that they cannot digest, they would rather take a pill or drink some chalky drink to sooth their indigestion. Most people would rather be fat and buy bigger and bigger clothes—and even buy an electric cart to move their fat ass around in—because they are so fat now it hurts to walk, then to lose fat.

Consequently, most people would rather take more and more chemical drugs, have more surgeries, get dialysis, wear diapers and buy an electric scooter to ride in than to do a <strong>5-Day KIDNEY Detox</strong> and get healthy.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>Getting Off Of Drugs…</strong></span>
In my clinic, I found that 100% of my patients—<strong>that’s right, 100% OF THEM</strong>—were all able to be healthy, stop taking ALL medication and <strong>STOP ALL DRUGS</strong> by making very easy and simple changes in their lifestyle. But, there is the dirty word—CHANGE—and back to the beginning, most people are lazy and do not want to change.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>There is HOPE!</strong></span>
Thankfully nowadays, more and more people are losing faith in modern medicine. Television is loaded with ads and between the ads for drugs are other ads from lawyers asking you if you want to sue your doctor or the drug company for giving you drugs that harmed you or killed your relatives. Almost every supposed wonder drug, in only a few short years, is discovered to have serious, harmful side effects and has maimed or killed people. Additionally, almost ALL medical treatments, especially for degenerative diseases, have been proven to NOT be effective. Worse, they have proven to be detrimental, even lethal. Today, many authorities say that you will live just as long—if not longer—if you do NOTHING AT ALL, instead of undergoing aggressive medical treatment.

<strong>FACT: In America, we spend more money per person on medical care than any other country in the world, but we don’t even make it into the top 15 countries when it comes to longevity.</strong>

So in this new millennium, modern medicine, doctors, drugs and hospitals are no longer looked at as they were in the 1950s. Trying to poison people into health just doesn’t work very well. They have grossly over-promised and under-delivered when it comes to healing disease and are now viewed with more skepticism than ever. Modern medicine has done a terrific job at shooting itself in the foot so I won’t say anymore.

The bottom line is that very few people today think doctors, drugs and hospitals are safe, and are looking for alternative ways to cure disease and regain their health.

<strong>But back to my main point… In my clinic, 100% of my patients were able to get off of ALL of their drugs, if they were willing to make the necessary positive changes in their lifestyle, and simply STOP making themselves sick.</strong>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>What were these LIFESTYLE changes?</strong></span>
I will break the changes down into a few simple categories that I made EVERY patient do, so they could successfully STOP taking ALL of their drugs…

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>INTAKE: Food &amp; Liquid</strong></span>
START consuming plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and STOP eating ALL animal food and ALL junk food.

For exact details of this food program, see my book “Detoxification: Volume One”. You can read it right on my BLOG, just click on the book and go to “My Three Clinical Food Programs” on page 53, or call and ask for a FREE copy of this book by calling 1-800-HERB-DOC (437-2362).

And, to make sure you are flooding your blood, cells and body with nutrition, I had all my patients use my <strong>SuperFood Plus!</strong>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>ELIMINATION: Routine Detoxification &amp; Cleansing</strong></span>
Immediately start on my 5-Day Detox Programs. You need to do to get ALL of your elimination organs clean, toned and functioning normally. Then, continue to do a 5-Day Detox every season for life. I have nine Bowel Digestive and Elimination Herbal Medicines, and three 5-Day Detox Programs. If you are serious about getting off of drugs, try them all.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>MOVEMENT: Daily Exercise</strong></span>
Begin a daily movement program for an hour EVERY day. Start out slow and increase the duration and intensity, as you get healthier and stronger.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>EMOTIONAL: Positive, Healthy Living</strong></span>
We have all been polluted, all of our lives, with health destroying, negative affirmations. We need to STOP them and replace them with positive healing and life and health-affirming, positive affirmations. At the top of this BLOG is a horizontal navigation bar, go to the right and put your cursor on “Quotes and Healing Affirmations”, click on “Healing Affirmations” for a great place to start.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>REPLACEMENT MEDICINE: Herbal Medicine</strong></span>
Use herbal medicine, which when assisted by you creating a healthy lifestyle can be just as effective at healing disease than any pharmaceutical drug. Better yet, herbal medicine acts more like food for the body, helping it to HEAL ITSELF, instead of forcing some metabolic action and does not have the negative side effects as drugs. So, I would get my patients to replace their chemical medicine with natural herbal medicine.

<strong>For information on all of these categories—AND MUCH MORE—see my book, “20 Powerful Steps To A Healthier Life”.  Just go to the right side of this blog site, look for this book cover, click it and read it for FREE.</strong>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>What if the DRUGS I am taking are keeping me ALIVE?</strong></span>
Let’s not be stupid here and die to prove a point. If the drugs you are taking are literally keeping you alive, DO NOT STOP TAKING THEM.

BUT, having said that, 99% of my patients who thought that they would never be able to wean themselves off of their drugs, and whose medical doctors thought they would never be able to live without their drugs, were able to eventually stop taking them. They simply had to improve their lifestyle to be even healthier, and then they were able to wean off the drugs.

In most circumstances it is important to do this slowly. You will know when the time is right. For instance, if you are Diabetic, you will see when you start creating a healthy lifestyle, you will need less and less insulin. Depending on the severity of your Diabetes, and the length you have had this disease, this will also determine the intensity that you will need to do my programs, and also the time it may take to get off of all of your insulin. And, you must master a low glycemic food program, and really understand about eating whole, natural foods that are hard to digest, (which will naturally have a low GI). You’ll also need to learn to love exercise and get rid of any and ALL FAT. Get the point? When you do all of this and much much more, you will see your blood sugar drop. Then, you can reduce your insulin and eventually get off of it. For everyone the program will be different. The same is true for any and all drugs.

Sometimes, it is at this point that my patients who said that they were willing to do ANYTHING to be well, do ANYTHING to heal their disease and do ANYTHING to stop taking their drugs REALIZED THAT THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO DO ANYTHING after all!

There is nothing wrong with this. I always said, everyone thinks they would like to drive an expensive car, but when they see what the payments and cost will be, well, the rusty old junker isn’t so bad after all. I do not judge. I am simply here to tell you what is possible and offer you a new chance at life free of disease and free of drugs.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>Almost ALL of my Patients…</strong></span>
Most of my patients had some type of disease and also had high cholesterol, high blood sugar or high blood pressure, if not all three! They had a number of aches, pains and diseases. They had all of these issues simply because they…

- Ate a lot of crap, and drank crap!
- Did not get enough nutrition!
- Had poor digestion and elimination!
- Had congested bowels, livers, gallbladders and kidneys!
- Were overweight!
- Didn’t move their ass enough!
- Were negative!

<strong>Then, when I had them CHANGE their lifestyle and REPLACE these DISEASE CAUSING BAD HABITS with POSITIVE, HEALTHY HABITS… Their DISEASES WENT AWAY and they could STOP TAKING ALL OF THEIR DRUGS!</strong>

Your medical doctor is ASSuming that you will not make these positive changes. In fact, they have NO EXPERIENCE in the curing power of these positive changes, and don’t even believe that they will work.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>They DO and they WILL!</strong></span>
The hospitals and pharmaceutical companies hope you don’t make these changes. Their income depends on you NOT making these changes. A patient cured, IS MONEY LOST! It is that simple.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><strong>Is there EVER a time to take drugs?</strong></span>
<strong>ABSOLUTELY! </strong>Some of you may be shocked by this answer, the great Dr. Schulze saying to take chemical drugs, but please let me explain. I believe there are TWO times to take chemical drugs.

<strong>#1: TRAUMA</strong>
In cases of extreme trauma, like bad car wrecks or any circumstance where your life is immediately threatened due to great bodily harm, injury or the rapid onset of a life-threatening disease, this is when modern medicine excels, often far beyond the scope of Natural Healing.

In situations such as this, I highly suggest using as much surgery and taking as many drugs as necessary to save your life and stabilize you. Then, once you are stable, as soon as possible, get the hell out of the hospital before they kill you because you can do the remainder of the healing naturally at home.

<strong>Don’t be stupid and don’t die trying to prove that Natural Healing and herbal medicine works.</strong> I already know it does, so save your ass first, we can always do a liver flush later.

<strong>#2: YOU ARE OLD</strong>
We are ALL going to eventually die. No matter how clean you live, no matter how powerful of health that you create, no matter how perfect your lifestyle is and no matter how positive you are, eventually you will die.

Eventually your body will start to fail, your genetic weaknesses will surface and your body will start to breakdown, fall apart and become diseased. With most Americans this will be cardiovascular or heart disease, or cancer.

When this happens, modern medicine, hospitals and pharmaceutical drugs may be able to give you a few more years, and if this is what you want, WHY NOT!

What is IMPORTANT is to also maintain your quality of life while you are going for the most quantity and longevity. Most of my patients did not want to be lying almost paralyzed, in pain, vomiting, in a diaper, doped up on morphine, and paying $5,000 a day just to squeeze out a few more months of life. You get the picture. At this point, it is time to move on to the next adventure and celebrate a life well lived.

Don’t give away your family nest egg and throw away what little money you have saved after bills and taxes, and give it all to the hospitals just to have anyone lie in a hospital bed feeling like hell, living in hell, this is silly too. Use your common sense!

BUT, if a few drugs can keep you maintaining a great quality of life, and hold off disease and death a few more years, why the heck not? I have never seen anything wrong with this.

BUT, HERE IS THE BIG BUT… Just make sure THAT YOU HAVE DONE ALL OF MY PROGRAMS FIRST, done ALL of my Natural Healing programs, using ALL of your herbal medicine, and made ALL of my suggested lifestyle changes, done ALL of my 20 Steps, and have done 110% at creating the best, healthiest and most positive life possible. 99% of the time when my patients, or their relatives, thought that they had done this, I was able to see 100 more healthy changes that the person could make, and I had them do this for a few months, and their disease completely went away and their health came back, WITHOUT DRUGS. So it is important to stay off of any drugs as long as possible.

And, if you have done it ALL and you are still dying..., and you can get a few more years with drugs, bring on the drugs.

FINALLY, Patty…

If your father is like most of my patients that were in their eighties, he has not done what I just stated above. So, if he wants to and he is willing to step-up his health programs, his herbal medicine and his healthy lifestyle a few notches, he will probably be able to stay off the drugs for a few more years. Who knows, maybe even for the next decade? Now you can reserve the use of drugs, if you need them at all, until you cannot keep him stable with lifestyle and herbal medicine alone.

Doctor Patty, you are a GREAT mom and a GREAT daughter. Just keep learning and growing and celebrate it ALL!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s summer, my friends, so let’s have some FUN! Remember, FUN is FUNdamental in EVERYTHING that you do in life! An old cowboy friend of mine from Deadwood, South Dakota, Jerry Croft told me once, “Love what you do and you’ll never work a day in your life.” I think that’s great advice. (Hollywood Note: Jerry made most of Tom Selleck’s great looking leather gear for the award winning western, Quigley Down Under.) Anyway, I think you all know that I LOVE what I DO. I have dedicated my life to educating everyone on Natural Healing and Herbal Medicine and that is what this BLOG site is all about.

So, for the entire month of August, while many of you are on a well-deserved vacation, I am working on our all-new 2012 Herbal Products Catalog, which my customers will receive in mid-September. I need to focus on the new things I am writing for this catalog and getting it out to you, so I am taking a short break from answering your questions on this BLOG for the month of August.

<strong>I’ll bet you haven’t seen all five!</strong>
Over the past six months, a lot of you have asked me to re-run a few of my older short “classic” video clips from the archives, so for August I have decided to replay the TOP FIVE short videos of the past few years, <em>counting down from number five.</em>

How did I pick the TOP FIVE? I didn’t, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YOU DID!</strong></span> I just paid attention to your responses, your letters, emails and what the BLOG site statistics tell me. So we could call these the <strong>“Dr. Schulze’s People’s Choice Short Video Awards”</strong>. Then in September I will get back to answering all of your questions right on this BLOG. So let’s get going!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Below is a question from Debbie M. in Boyertown, PA. Sometimes it is best if I answer a customer’s letter within the letter itself so it makes more sense, and this is what I am doing below...

<i><span style="color: #B5111B;">Dear Dr. Schulze,
I’m so glad you finally got your blog up and running.  Thank you for your persistence. I have been a fan since I bought the book “Curing with Cayenne” and have been making the women’s formula ever since.

In my forties this formula helped with severe cramping. I just turned 55 and am now perimenopausal. My parents both have reproductive cancer. My mother has since passed from breast cancer. The doctors say it was estrogen driven. Someone in the health field told me I shouldn't take the women’s formulas because some of the herbs may have an estrogenic effect and since my mother had estrogen driven breast cancer, I should stop. Well, that scared me and I stopped about a year ago…  </span></i>

OK, let’s begin…

First, you say that this formula helped you with severe cramping and that you started taking it at age 40 and that you are now 55 and I am assuming that you have been taking the formula for 15 years, either straight or on and off. This all sounds good.

You also state that BOTH of your parents have reproductive cancer and that your Mom has passed away from it, and that the medical doctors said it was estrogen driven.

The first thing I did in my clinic with every patient was take a health history, which would include all of their relatives and going back to grandparents. If both of your parents have reproductive cancer, and you mother has actually died from it, this does in fact put you in a higher risk group for developing reproductive cancer, BUT, it is not a guarantee at all that you will develop cancer at all, and I am sure that you will NOT. So take a breath here, please.

If you live a very different life than your parents, physically, emotionally and spiritually, and have a very different lifestyle, then you can expect to have a very different health outcome. Basically, you can expect to be healthy and cancer-free.

Remember, your level of health is determined by your GENETICS REACTING to your LIFESTYLE, meaning, that you may be genetically predisposed to reproductive cancer, (and there is nothing that you can do about that, that's water under the bridge) but if you create a powerfully healthy lifestyle, again, not just physically, but also emotionally and spiritually, well, you simply WILL NOT develop reproductive cancer. On the other hand, if you live in a similar way as your parents did, or even a lower quality or lower health lifestyle, well you can expect a similar outcome, possibly creating Reproductive Cancer.

For all of us, the best way to PREVENT genetic weaknesses (family diseases) from developing in our bodies, and the best way to pass on stronger genetic coding to our children, is to live a healthy life. I don’t want to sound like a German geneticist or Dr. “Adolph” Schulze here, but this is a very basic law of Nature. The weak become diseased and die out and the strong survive, and I want to make sure that you are strong, healthy, live long, and that we will all create stronger and healthier future generations.

OK, so good so far.

Then you say:

<i><span style="color: #B5111B;">“Someone” in the “health field” told me I shouldn’t take the women’s formulas because some of the herbs may have an estrogenic effect and since my mother had estrogen driven cancer, I should stop.  Well, that scared me and I stopped about a year ago…</span> </i>

They were wrong!

This is where I have a problem—<i>‘Someone in the health field’</i>. Just like medical doctors, there are so many people in the health field that mean well, but don’t really know what they are talking about and pass on a lot of misinformation, even real stupid suggestions and even more ridiculous treatment ideas. This is the vast MAJORITY of both medical doctors <i>and </i>natural health professionals.

To make things worse, the vast MAJORITY of “health practitioners” and even “natural” doctors, still THINK like medical doctors, using standard medical algorithms or thought patterns with treatments, meaning they think and treat just like medical doctors, and this is where the problem lies. Let me explain…

Herbs are just one of the many tools of Natural Healing. They are to be used along with healthy food programs, flexibility, movement and exercise programs, cleansing and detoxification routines, emotional and spiritual programs and hundreds of other positive lifestyle changes.

Herbal Medicines, when used correctly, are never used like a drug. Herbs do not act like drugs, and should not be prescribed like drugs. Many herbalists around the world, if you have a headache, would prescribe herbs for reducing pain—I definitely would not. Unfortunately most people, who practice natural medicine, do so with an allopathic or standard medical doctor’s mindset.

If you have a headache, I want to know WHY, not, I repeat NOT, <i>just kill the pain</i>. You can have a headache for 1,000 different reasons from tight neck muscles and stress, to constipation, toxicity, eyestrain or even a brain tumor. Pain is the way the body communicates and lets us know that something is out of balance. To tell it to shut up, and use drugs <i>or even herbs</i>, to make it go away without knowing why it exists is a very ignorant form of medicine that is practiced by most doctors, both Orthodox and Alternative.

The herbs in any of my Female Formulas do not contain estrogen, nor would these herbs promote any cancer in your body, nor would they promote your body to develop any cancer, in fact they will do just the opposite.

The herbs do contain nutrients that your body can use to build hormones, but only if you need them. Mostly what these herbs do, is sensitize or assist your body to be more sensitive in detecting the amount of hormones that you have created that are present in your bloodstream and then <i>suppressing</i> or <i>stimulating</i> the manufacture of them, as needed.

For instance, many of the female herbs in my Female Formulas have been found to work by increasing the sensitivity of the hypothalamus organ in your brain. It’s the hypothalamus that constantly checks your blood for hormone levels every minute of every day. If it detects that you are low in any endocrine chemical (like a hormone such as estrogen) it will release chemicals that tell your ovaries to produce more estrogen. If the hypothalamus detects that you have enough estrogen, it will release other chemicals that slow down or even stop your ovaries from producing estrogen. So you can see that these herbs do not contain estrogen, but instead sensitize your own endocrine system to produce exactly the amount of hormones, or estrogen, that your body decides that you need, not what I (or any doctor) <i>thinks </i>you need. 

Since I don’t use herbs that actually contain estrogen, you have nothing to worry about. 

Now, having said that, all animal foods, because of the huge amount of growth hormones and steroids that are used in all meat, milk and egg production, are loaded with residual growth hormones and steroids. So, when you consume animals and their byproducts, you consume large amounts of these growth hormones and steroids. The residual hormones and steroids in animal food and animal byproducts have been directly linked to the increase in reproductive cancers, including breast, uterine and ovarian in women, and prostate and testicular in men. So if you read my books and follow my work, then you already know that—especially for you with a family history of cancer—that I highly recommend a vegan food program. Even the American Cancer Society says that this will reduce your risk of cancer. So this is the FIRST place this “health practitioner” should have gone, stopping you from consuming any animal food, and left the herbal medicine advice to the herbal doctors.

<i><span style="color: #B5111B;">Now my symptoms are crampiness and spotting almost every day. I tried going back on the formula, but I started to get slight hot flashes, so I stopped again.  When I started taking it, was I just not taking enough? Now, I don’t know what to do. I’m thinking I should be taking it to balance my hormones, but don’t want hot flashes. I would love to hear your thoughts.

— Debbie M. in Boyertown, PA </span> </i>

OK, let me give you a few of my thoughts here…

First, relax; this is not such a big deal. I know this is very important to you, and your health, but I do not feel that you are in any serious danger, just a little bit out of balance. So it is important that you keep this in perspective.

<b>#1: </b>At the beginning of your letter you state that you have been ‘making’ my formulas for years—I hope this is a typo and you meant ‘taking’ my formula for years. If it is not, and you are actually ‘making’ my herbal formula, this may be the beginning of your problem. As you know, I do promote people to make their own herbal medicine if they want to. But, my concern here is that any herbal medicine that you make, can only be as powerful as the herbs you begin with. I am a fanatic; in fact, fanatic is not even close to a powerful enough word to describe how insane I am about herbal quality and my manufacturing techniques for my herbal medicine. Please, read the beginning of my catalog under why my herbal formulas are the very best. I am not tooting my own horn here, or pumping up my ego, but it is one thing to make your own herbal medicine for general use, and another thing to make it to save your life. I suggest you start using my <b>Female Formula</b>, at least for a while, as I know exactly how I make it. This is the exact formula that created the extremely positive results with my patients in my clinic.

<b>#2: </b>I definitely suggest getting some of my <b>Female Formula </b>and start using 2 droppersful three times a day. With an additional dose of 2 droppersful anytime you need it. And, if you are having a powerful negative symptom of menopause—like extreme hot flashes, night sweats or any other symptom—I suggest using my <b>Female “SHOT”</b> immediately. Then, after a period of time when you feel that your hormones are back in balance and that you are healthy again, you can feel free to start making your own herbal medicine if that is what you want to do. But at least for now, please, use my herbal medicine, until we get you healthy, strong and out of any danger.

<b>#3: </b>You are not your mother and you are not your father. Sure, you have inherited many of their genetic strengths and weaknesses. But remember, you do not have to <i>live out</i> any of their genetic weaknesses, and the best way to make absolutely sure that you do not manifest any of their, or your, genetic weaknesses is to live a much healthier lifestyle—physically, emotionally and spiritually—then your parents did. I am sure that your parents did a lot of great things; all I’m asking of you is an UPGRADE. I want you to take a good look at what your parents taught you. And then I want you to eliminate the bad, keep the good, and create a new, more healthier lifestyle for yourself then your parents did for themselves. 

So stop worrying, get healthier, have fun and let’s get going on Creating Powerful Health.

— Dr. Schulze

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a friend who just died. So I wanted to share a few truths with you, about life, dis-ease, healing, and death. <strong>For those of you that only have two minutes, I Put The Most Important Points In Bold.</strong>

This friend was diagnosed many years ago with the deadliest of diseases, a rare form of cancer. The medical doctors said he only had a few months to live.

<strong>He was a man of some faith, so I reminded him that only God knows when a person will live or die, not medical doctors.</strong> And from my experience, the medical doctors are dead wrong, pun intended, far more often than not.

<strong>In fact, if I had a hundred dollars for every patient of mine that was told they would be dead in a few months, only to live decades after their “medical death sentence”, well, I would be a far richer man than I am today.</strong>

Anyway, this man decided to give my Incurables Program a try. He wasn’t a great patient; he didn’t even meet my minimum requirements. Sure, he drank some of the drinks, took some of the herbal medicines, and went through some of the motions of some of the programs, but generally, he had that medical mindset that some of my patients had been brainwashed into: <strong>In the back of his mind somewhere, he <i>believed</i> the medical doctors, he <i>believed</i> their diagnosis, their prognosis, and I think he felt that they were very smart people, and therefore they must be at least partly correct. To me this is kind of like believing that the President, or the Queen, or the Pope is the smartest person in the world, or is psychic. I think he felt that somehow surgery, at some point, was going to help him. This can be a deadly mistake, much more deadly than any disease.</strong>

<strong>I think he expected me, or my herbal formulas, to almost magically heal his cancer. He said if it did, he would tell the masses, at which point I told him I didn’t need “this kind of attention”. He never saw the healing process as “him healing himself” and creating powerful health.</strong> I know if he would have just believed, he could have healed himself of anything.

His worst failure, was that he absolutely refused to take what I consider enough time off, to heal himself—at least three or four months, if not six—but again to be fair he did some of the program. So I fired him as a patient, after three days, and then again after five days, but we kept in touch.

<strong>By the way, in case anyone is wondering, I am not Jesus, nor a prophet of God. I have never healed anyone. I cannot heal anyone. All I can do is <i>Illuminate the Healing Path</i>, for a person to walk on, guide them on their Healing Adventure with my wisdom, and supply them with some of the Healing Tools that they will need along their Journey.</strong>

OK, so he got very lucky and had his healing miracle, his minimum involvement was enough, he created his own healing miracle, and his disease went into remission, and as my patients often experienced in my clinic, the disease was eaten up by his own immune system. Often when this happens, when the cancer is literally destroyed by your own immune cells, then just the fiber or “skeleton” of the cancer remains. He even had the medical doctors perform a biopsy, and they said, “we don’t even know what this is anymore… it is NOT cancer, it is just some dead cells.” I said, “Wonderful, we have had another healing miracle.” But the medical doctors, nor him, were satisfied with this. They could not leave miracles alone, so they all decided to go in and “clean things up,” which I always feel is a drastic mistake, for a few reasons…

<strong>First, surgery in itself causes a drastic reduction in our life energy, our chi, ki, prana, pilot light, or energy level, whatever you want to call it. I always say unless a surgery is absolutely necessary, and you will be dead in hours unless you have it, then DO NOT have it!</strong>

His cancer had been devoured by his immune system, it was gone as far as I was concerned, and to go in with invasive surgery, just to clean out already dead cancer, is simply a waste of time, money and a HUGE waste of your internal energy. Your body will do this eventually anyway. This was NOT a good idea, especially when you have just healed yourself from a supposedly very lethal disease. I have faith in our body’s ability to completely heal itself of any disease—<i>he did not</i>. So he just couldn’t help himself, he did it, he had the “clean up surgery” and it was a huge energetic blow to him, like getting hit by a car… no, a TRUCK!

Another reason to avoid surgery whenever possible, but especially when you are healing yourself of cancer, is that I believe the surgical procedure itself can cause the cancer to spread. Actually, it is more than just a belief… I have seen this happen time and time again.

<strong>Some of you might wonder why he got sick in the first place. Well, many reasons that I could see.</strong>

To give you the best of my decades of clinical practice, ALL diseases are caused by a combination of things, and cancer is no different.

<strong>ALL disease is caused by:

Inherited genetic predispositions

(or)

Diseases that are activated or created by physical, emotional and spiritual poisons

Most often, it is a combination of both.

Physically</strong>
Physically, he could have been poisoned by a number of carcinogenic chemicals that are present in almost all of our lives. He worked at a very large manufacturing company, and this company uses chemicals in manufacturing that are known carcinogens. So he could have been exposed to many manufacturing toxins, or just environmental toxins that are commonly present on most work environments. 

<strong>Emotional Trauma</strong>
Emotionally, there were many obvious poisons. He had a huge emotional trauma during his career, and when he explained it to me, he said it was like getting struck right in the guts, at which time he unknowingly pointed to exactly where the cancer lied underneath. He also said that he had physical pain there for a few years after, and even a “twinge” now and then ever since.

<strong>Many diseases (especially cancer) are often caused, at least in part, by powerful emotional upsets that we never resolve, or forgive and forget.</strong> And this man had a huge one. He wasn’t big on forgiveness—he was big on getting even. 

<strong>Spiritual Trauma</strong>
This man had also made some business decisions that he was not proud of making, <i>to put it mildly</i>. A few of them were very big decisions that made the company a lot of money, but they were decisions that he did not feel good about making at all. He had severe guilt and severe shame about this one decision that he was just in the process of making.

I suggested a solution, which was to simply… NOT DO IT. But my simple and very healing solution, well, it was just overwhelming to him. He couldn’t even imagine admitting his mistake, let alone stopping this project that was just about to launch. It would have cost the company millions of dollars and blah, blah, blah. I believe this guilt, shame and “spiritual trauma” was a big part of why his immune system was shutting down, and why he developed cancer.

A great Guru once told me, “You can’t get what you want out of life, by doing what you don’t want to do”. WOW, how simple is that? This man was simply doing what he did not want to do, and “it” was killing him. What is this “IT”? This “IT” was him, so a better more accurate statement would have been “I am killing myself” if I do this thing. Well, he did it, and he did! We are all extremely successful, powerfully successful, and get exactly what we want. If we are not getting the results we want, then we simply need to change our program.

<strong>You cannot be healthy and disease-free carrying a huge amount of guilt, shame and remorse around. We are human—we ALL screw up! Be honest with yourself. Fix any mistakes you have made the best way you can, the best way you know how, and then MOVE ON! </strong>

I have a very smart CPA and many, many years ago I was considering an investment that was so complex, neither of us even understood it. He simply said to me, no matter how much money you make on this deal, if you lose sleep over it, it’s not worth it. He then went on to explain to me that he judges all deals based on their “sleep factor”. He said that if any investment or any business deal keeps you awake at night, worrying, it is not worth doing it. So I did NOT do this deal, and I have slept like a baby following this important advice, ever since. 

<strong>The bottom line is that carrying around guilt and shame will make you sick and kill you, as effectively as any disease. Actually, it is part of the disease!</strong>

<strong>OK, so now my friend is dead. So what is my point here? Well, I have a few…</strong>

First, I only share this story with you so we can ALL avoid these same mistakes and pitfalls in our own lives. He would have liked this.

<strong>If you are seriously ill, with any one of the thousands of life-threatening diseases, and you want to heal your dis-ease naturally, well, you simply need to take enough time off to heal yourself. In my clinical experience, the minimum is three months on the programs, but with getting started and recuperation, plan on six months.</strong> If you will not take the time off, well, this is what medical doctors, drugs and surgery are for.

<strong>Medical doctors are NOT Natural Healers. If you are going to embark on a Natural Healing Adventure, STOP listening to them. In fact, STOP asking them questions. In fact, STOP going to them. By the way, they DO NOT know when you are going to die!

Dr. Schulze is NOT Jesus, Buddha, Moses, Mohammed, Lao Tzu, Confucius or any other prophet of God or spiritual leader. He has never healed anyone, except himself. ALL of his patients healed themselves!

ALL diseases have physical, emotional and spiritual components. It is very important when healing yourself to identify as many of these disease-causing factors as possible, and eliminate them. They can be toxic food, toxic emotions and toxic spiritual poisons. Guilt and shame can kill just as fast as French fries and trans-fatty acids—actually faster.

Surgery in itself causes a drastic reduction in our life energy—our chi, ki, prana, pilot light, energy level—whatever you want to call it. Only consider it if you will be dead in hours without it. Otherwise, postpone it as long as possible.

With ALL of your decisions in life, remember… consider the “sleep factor”.</strong>

OK, I’ll see you next week!

<strong>— Dr. Schulze</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with being an herbal doctor, I have also been an herbal “veterinarian” all of my life. Pets are simply another member of most families in the modern world, in fact, most of my patients loved their pets more than some of their relatives. Because of this, my patients have asked me to treat their pets’ illnesses ever since I started in this business.</p>

<p>I realized 30 years ago that an entire bottle of Intestinal Formula #1, removed from the capsules, and mixed with a gallon of warm water, and then tubed into a horse through the nostril, was the absolute cure for colic, which is the #1 killer in horses. I also realized long ago that you better wrap a cat in a towel, or tape a dog’s mouth shut, before you apply Anti-I Tincture to their open wounds, and I have a few scars from bites and scratches to prove this valuable lesson.</p>

<p><div style="float:left;"><a href="javascript: swapVideoZB (&quot;pet_nutrition_2_playlist;Nutrition-For-Your-Pets-900&quot;, &quot;&quot;)"><img style="padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 3px; border: 0px none;" src="/images/video/ds.jpg" /></a></div>
<div class="videoLink" style="float: left;"><a href="javascript: swapVideoZB (&quot;pet_nutrition_2_playlist;Nutrition-For-Your-Pets-900&quot;, &quot;&quot;)">Click to View</a></div></p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><div style="float:left;"><a href="javascript: swapVideoZB (&quot;pet_nutrition_playlist;pet_nutrition&quot;, &quot;&quot;)"><img style=" padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 3px; border: 0px none;" src="/images/video/pets.jpg" /></a></div><div class="videoLink" style="float: left;"><a href="javascript: swapVideoZB (&quot;pet_nutrition_playlist;pet_nutrition&quot;, &quot;&quot;)">Click to View</a></div></p>

<p style="margin-top:200px;">But, if I have learned one thing over the years, whenever treating any animal, they ALL need better nutrition just like us, in order to heal their diseases, recover from their injuries and be healthy and strong. So many years ago—right after I invented SuperFood—I was asked to treat an entire stable of horses with ringworm, and besides creating 20 gallons of diluted Anti-I Tincture to wash them with, I also fed all the horses large amounts of SuperFood Plus Powder, mixed with alfalfa and molasses, to supercharge their nutrition and immune system and get them healthy, fast!</p>

<p>Then, when I finally made the SuperFood Plus Tablets, well, they were the absolute natural and perfect nutritional treat for dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, mice, miniature pigs, you name it—ALL household pets. After all, our pets need super nutrition too, to live healthy and disease-free, just like us.</p>

<p>Anyway, a year or so ago a woman posted the second video clip I have here on YouTube, and I loved it. That inspired me to make this first video clip and show you a little bit about one of my personal morning rituals. OK, don’t judge my Dr. Schulze attire, just check out how much my dogs and cats (cats not in the video) LOVE their morning SuperFood Plus party.</p>

<p>And, before you ask how many tablets to give them, just use my weight rule for children with your animals too, by putting their approximate weight over 150 pounds.</p>

<p>So for a 50-pound dog, 50/150-lbs is 1/3 the adult dose or 5 SuperFood Plus Tablets. And a 10-pound cat should get one or two tablets (although I give my cats 5 and they get buzzed). Then, for and a 1500-pound horse, 1500/150-lbs would be 10 TIMES the adult dose.</p>

<p>Don’t worry… I’ve never overdosed any animals, even human animals, on nutrition.</p>

<p>Enjoy your pets, keep them healthy and HAVE FUN!</p>

<p>— Dr. Schulze</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I always get response letters to my BLOG postings. Most of them are <i>“Thank You's”</i>, a few are <i>“Burn in Hell, Dr. Schulze”</i>, and some are great <i>“Healing Testimonials”</i> of customers who were usually sicker and worse than the customer who wrote the letter, and then healed their diseases using my programs. As usual, I got a lot of responses to last week’s BLOG—<i>my answer to Regina M. from Lakeside, CA</i>—whose kidneys were failing, functioning at only 9%, and on 10 Pharmaceutical Drugs. Here are two AWESOME responses!</p>
<br />
<br />
<p style="text-align:center; color:red;font-size:200%;"><strong>Response From A Medical Doctor</strong></p>

<p  style="color:red;"><i>Dr. Schulze, <p>

<p style="color:red;">You were <strong>incorrect.</strong> Regina, the lady that you answered in your BLOG, <strong>is on 11 medications!</strong> The pain medication she is on <strong>Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen</strong> (Norco) 10-325 mg. is a horrible kidney toxin and a combination of two different drugs (Acetaminophen plus Hydrocodone). This counts as two meds. So the story is even worse than you stated, and it gets worse…</p>

<p style="color:red;">She’s also on Lasix (Furosemide). A friend of mine was talking with the president of (Sanofi Aventis) the company that manufactures Lasix. My friend was suggesting to the president that he had some tools to assist the kidneys. The president of this company got really angry and said he’d fight my friend if necessary. He said his company made, get this… <strong>$20,000,000.00 net profit PER DAY from the sales of Furosemide alone!!!</strong></p>

<p style="color:red;">I am an MD who supports the kind of advice you gave this poor soul! Please, keep it up!</p>

<p style="color:red;">— R.M., MD</p>
<p style="color:red;">(name and city/town withheld at medical doctor’s request) </p></i>

<br />
<br />
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:200%;"><strong>Response from Dr. Schulze</strong></p>
<p>Doc, thank you so much for your support and your information. I often find out from medical doctors like you, that the reality is even worse than I stated, or even imagined. And I knew that the diuretic and adult diaper business was huge, but as usual, I underestimated the enemy. </p>

<p>I really appreciate your support of my common sense natural medicine. We need a lot more medical doctors like you, my friend. </p>

<p>— Dr. Schulze</p>

<p><strong>Lasix, has 41 additional names…</strong><br />
Like sugar, Lasix is sold under at least 41 different names besides its brand name (Lasix) and its generic name (Furosemide). Here they are: Aisemide, Apo-Furosemide, Beronald, Desdemin, Discoid, Diural, Diurapid, Dryptal, Durafurid, Edemid, Errolon, Eutensin, Flusapex, Frudix, Frusetic, Frusid, Fulsix, Fuluvamide, Furesis, Furix, Furo-Puren, Furosedon, Fusid.frusone, Hydro-rapid, Impugan, Katlex, Lasilix, Lodix, Lowpston, Macasirool, Mirfat, Nicorol, Odemase, Oedemex, Profemin, Rosemide, Rusyde, Salix, Trofurit, Uremide and Urex.</p>

<p><strong>Also, click to watch this <a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000056780" target="_blank">VIDEO</a> if you want to see this same multi-national trillion dollar pharmaceutical company and their $$$ focus!</strong></p>

<br />
<br />
<p style="text-align:center; color:red;font-size:200%;"><strong>My Mom Was Worse And Is Healing Herself!</strong></p>

<p style="color:red;"><i>Dear Dr. Schulze,</p>

<p style="color:red;">Please pass my response on to Regina M. of Lakeside, CA, the person whose question you answered in last week’s BLOG re: kidneys functioning at 9%.</p>

<p style="color:red;">In August of this year (three months ago) my Mom, who is 71 years old, had a GFR of 6. (This equals a kidney function of only 6% to 7%, worse than Regina.) She was in Stage 5 (the worst and final stage) of kidney disease. She was referred to a specialist who advised her she must be placed on dialysis immediately. She asked to have two weeks reprieve before starting. The specialist agreed. (We later discovered that the specialist didn't hold out any hope for her anyways.)</p>

<p style="color:red;"><strong>We inquired to the medical doctor about using herbs.  We were advised they could kill her</strong> and then we were told to go to a drugstore and get an OTC vitamin B supplement and folic acid. GAME ON! </p>

<p style="color:red;">I asked her if she wanted to be doctored, or if she wanted to be healed (she chose healed). She ceased consuming all fast food and frozen dinners (her main dietary staples). At the time she was not able to keep much food down, so she started with the <strong>SuperFood-100</strong> for basic nutrition. I made her drink as much <strong>K/B Tea</strong> as she could handle and got her on the <strong>K/B and Detox Formulae</strong>.  We estimate she did about 2/3 of the  <strong>5-Day Kidney Detox.</strong></p>

<p style="color:red;">Two weeks later her GBR was 9 (her kidney function INCREASED to from 6% to 10%) The medical doctor specialist was dumbfounded (as this never happens).  He wanted to biopsy her kidneys to determine what was causing the fluctuation.  As my mom comes from the generation of, "Doctor knows best," this was very difficult for her, but in her heart she knew the operation was wrong and might lead to her demise.  She declined the operation.</p>

<p style="color:red;">I'm happy to report that my mom's GBR is now 25 (a kidney function INCREASED to over 27%, from 6%) which puts her in only stage 4 kidney disease and not stage 5 anymore. (A reversal of kidney disease medical doctors know absolutely nothing about!) She has not eaten any fast food or frozen dinners since her diagnosis. She now eats raw organic food and adjusts some foods tailored to a kidney disease diet.</p>

<p style="color:red;">I thank God she chose healing over doctoring, and, most of all, I thank God you made that possible.  There is always hope!</p>

<p style="color:red;">If you would pass the above info on to Regina in Lakeside, I'd be appreciative.</p>

<p style="color:red;">— Elizabeth C. in Santa Maria, CA</i></p>
<br />
<br />
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:200%;"><strong>Response from Dr. Schulze</strong></p>
<p>Elizabeth, I thank God for daughters like you. Twenty or 30 years ago I would have asked you to come work for me in my clinic. Your mom is very lucky to have a daughter like you, so GREAT JOB! And keep it up, you are adding years, even decades to your mom’s life by refusing the biopsies, the dialysis and kidney transplants. You are saving your mom lots of sickness and torture, and saving yourself a lot of money. By the way, I guess the herbs didn’t kill her like the medical doctor predicted.</p>

<p>God Bless You!</p>

<p>— Dr. Schulze</p>

<p><strong>Apples to Apples…</strong><br />
Just to be correct, in the first BLOG answer from last week, Regina M. said her kidneys were only working at 9%. In the second response this week, Elizabeth C. said her mother’s GFR was at 6, which equates to the kidney function being at about 6% or 7%. For you health geeks I offer the following GFR tech intel…</p>

<p><strong>GFR for Health Geeks…</strong><br />
GFR or (glomerular filtration rate) is the total filtration rate of both of your kidneys working together. It is NOT an exact test, but rather a close estimate that your medical doctor can calculate from a blood test by counting the amount of filtration markers, like creatinine, that are present in your blood sample. This is the accepted standard estimate for overall kidney function and measured like 100mL/min/1.73 m2 or higher.</p>

<p>Basically a GFR of healthy people with kidneys that are healthy is between 90 and 116, above 90 usually for people under 60 with the highest ranges being in your twenties. From 60 to 69 years of age it is considered that 85 is normal and above 70 years of age it is considered that 75 is normal.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Food & Frozen Food = SALT Overdose = Kidney DISEASE!</strong><br />
Elizabeth C’s mother was on almost a pure diet of junk food and frozen food. These two foods are the highest in salt. Salt is used specifically to enhance the flavor of poor quality food, and food that is overcooked and old. Salt is also a preservative.</p>

<p>Salt is also the worst food in the world for anyone with kidney disease or kidney impairment. </p>

<p>Salt is necessary to help your body retain its fluid balance. But, all the salt that you need is already naturally present in food; you do not need additional salt except in extreme circumstances and extremely hot climates. </p>

<p>Now, if someone already has kidney disease, and their body is already retaining fluids because their kidneys are not healthy and not functioning well, they are retaining fluid anyway. Then you add in salt, which causes them to retain even more fluid. This causes the blood pressure to skyrocket, which in turn damages the sensitive filtering cells of the kidneys even further. This is a deadly killer cycle for your kidneys and one that millions and millions of Americans have fallen into, taking diuretics and anti-hypertensive drugs, and eating salt-laden junk food. When you cut out the salt and junk food, you don’t need the diuretic and blood pressure drugs anymore and your kidneys will heal themselves as Elizabeth experienced with her mother.</p>

<p><strong>BEWARE!<br />
Junk food, prepared frozen foods, and even restaurant food usually has between 20 and 50 times more salt added to it than is naturally present in the food, or that you would add at home!</strong></p>

<p>— Dr. Schulze</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <p><span style=''>Italian-born <span>covergirl</span> and high-fashion model <b>Elisa <span>Sednaoui</span></b>, who has graced the pages of such worldwide
    magazines as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Elle and W, and modeled for a wide array of
    names, ranging from Diane Von Furstenberg to Coach to Victoria’s Secret,
    reveals her Cold &amp; Flu Prevention Secret in the March 2012 issue of Marie
    Claire Magazine.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>That’s right&#8212;last
    year in <a href="https://herbdocblog.com/article/Commentary/oscar-winner-penelope-cruz-fights-pirates-and-a-cold" style="color:blue;">Marie Claire</a> magazine, the contents
    of <b>Penelope Cruz’s</b> purse contained her cold and flu prevention secret &#8211; <b>Dr.
    Schulze’s <span class="nowrap">Cold &amp; Flu Herbal “SHOT”</span></b>. </span></p>
  <br><p><span style=''>Now, Ms. <span>Sednaoui</span> has divulged her secret to staying cold and flu
    free too&#8212;and again it’s <b>Dr. Schulze’s Cold &amp; Flu Herbal “SHOT”!</b> Featured in Marie Claire magazine’s 101 IDEAS / BEAUTY SNOOP she is quoted as
    saying… </p>
  <p style="font-size:155%;color:#B5111B;"><b>“My friend helped me discover this. It’s so powerful!”</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>American Botanical Pharmacy
    would like to thank Project Runway judge Nina Garcia, who is the Fashion
    Director of Marie Claire magazine, for allowing unsolicited recommendations of
    our products from the stars&#8212;the truth speaks for itself!</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><div style='text-align:center;'><img style="border: 0px none;" src="/images/upload/MC_article.jpg"></div></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>A Note From Dr. Schulze:</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>Friends, as you know my
    clinics were in Hollywood and Malibu, California and at one time or another I
    worked with almost every famous Hollywood star, model, director, producer, etc.
    I never talk about them personally&#8212;NEVER&#8212;but occasionally some of
    them talk about me!</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>You know me, I am very
    focused on Natural Healing and Herbal Medicine but... at the same time I
    recognize that millions and millions of people read celebrity, star and fashion
    magazines and want to know what the stars are up to. So, I thought that from time
    to time I would post a few of these Dr. Schulze/Star stories that make the
    news, in case you missed them.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>I know, I know, many of you
    very serious health crusaders, like me, would rather hear about my routines for
    gallstones or cancer than what the stars are doing but... you also have friends
    and relatives that don't (or won't) take my herbal medicine just because you
    do, or even when you tell them to. Over the years I have found that they might
    take my medicine once they discover that Tom Cruise, Sting, Madonna, Steven <span>Seagal</span> or the President does, so it never hurts to release
    a few of these stories.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Remember, I am a diehard
    Natural Healing and Herbal Medicine evangelist and I will stop at nothing to
    try and get you&#8212;and your relatives and friends&#8212;to heal yourselves
    naturally, so that is why I do what I do!</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Peace,</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>&#8212; Dr. Schulze</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><span
style='color:red'>WARNING: I have been reporting on and disclosing the disgusting and
    toxic truth behind many of the dirty secrets of Chinese &ldquo;Herbal&rdquo; Medicine trade
    for over 40 years. Some of these truths are shocking, disgusting, and
    nauseating. This recent report is nothing short of HORRIFYING! Please do not
    read if you are weak of heart, or stomach.</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>Last week newspapers worldwide reported a horrifying discovery. </span><span
style=''><b>17,000 pills were
    smuggled into South Korea over the last year from China that contained powdered
    human baby skin and flesh. Not animal. HUMAN!</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>This dead baby trade is being run from China where corrupt medical
    doctors and staff take the tiny corpses or babies that are aborted, or
    delivered stillborn, and then smuggle them out of the hospitals and take them
    home and store them in their household refrigerators, and eventually cook and
    dehydrate the dead babies in microwaves. Numerous police agencies are involved;
    some suspecting that babies may even have been sold and murdered for this
    business.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''><img style="float:left;padding-right:12px;margin-top:3px;border:0px;" width=267 height=189
src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/petri.jpg"> </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Once the baby’s flesh and skin is thoroughly dried, it is pummeled into
    powder and then put into capsules <b>along
    with herbs</b>, often to disguise the actual ingredients from health
    investigators and customs officers.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>These discoveries have been since last August, and have even shocked
    some of the most hardened customs agents who are used to seeing some of the
    most disgusting Chinese &ldquo;Herbal&rdquo; Medicine from endangered species horns,
    organs, flesh, bones and sexual parts.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Customs agents claim the illegal Chinese medicine is smuggled through
    South Korea, and that there is a huge worldwide demand for alternative and
    herbal Chinese medicine. The Chinese claim that these types of medicine will
    make you younger, and restore sexual energy. The Chinese have historically
    consumed human placenta to improve blood supply and circulation, but the eating
    of dead baby corpses is a newer &ldquo;natural&rdquo; Chinese fad.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Customs agents have intercepted numerous dried baby corpse shipments
    that were <b>mixed with herbs</b> over the
    last year. The San Francisco Times reported that testing on the pills confirmed
    that they were made up of 99.7% human remains. The pills are marketed as <b>&ldquo;Herbal&rdquo; Stamina Boosters</b><i> (see my point later on this).</i></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>In light of this recent report, <b>I
    decided to reprint a handout that I used in my clinic from about 30 years ago,</b> that I wrote to enlighten, and warn my patients, many of whom had consumed
    Chinese &ldquo;Herbal&rdquo; Medicine to heal themselves, assuming that it was truly
    herbal, when in fact it was loaded with animal flesh, horns, sexual organs,
    dried insects and a lot of other bacteria rich, and really disgusting
    substances.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:135%'>Not About
    Saving the Whales</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>Finally, this is not some &ldquo;Save the Whales&rdquo;, Animal Rights article.
    Personally, I have chose to not eat animals for most of my life. I have come to
    the conclusion that the vast majority of diseases in America and most of the
    civilized world are &ldquo;<b>diseases of the
    fork</b>&rdquo;, meaning that they are caused by what we eat, drink and the sedentary
    nature of our lifestyle. Interestingly, my conclusion is also shared by quite
    conservative organizations such as the American Cancer Society and the American
    Heart Association. <b>There is no doubt
    that the consumption of animals contributes to, if not directly causes, the two
    biggest killers of mankind, heart disease and cancer.</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Regardless, <span class=GramE>this is not about saving animals</span>, <span>it is about saving lives</span>. People often say to me, well, what
    if there was a nuclear war, or accident, and all the plants died, would you eat
    animals? Or they ask, what if you were on a plane and it crashed in some barren
    wasteland where there were no edible plants, only animals, would you eat
    animals? Usually I answer this question by telling this person <b>that I would kill THEM first</b>, and eat
    them to survive, mainly to shut them up and stop asking stupid questions, and
    for nutrition, second. Then next, yes, I would kill animals and eat them if I
    had to, to survive. I would survive. I am a survivor!</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>But the reality is that we have an ABUNDANCE of amazing food available
    to us in the modern world, that is healthy and nutritious, and does not require
    the killing and eating of animals, reptiles, insects and other living,
    crawling, swimming or slithering creatures. And if you are trying to heal
    disease and create powerful health, I highly advise a food program that does
    not contain these substances.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Below is my clinical handout from 30 or 40 years ago, <i>edited, slightly updated and revised by me
    today.</i></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:135%;'><b>Buyer Beware! Chinese &ldquo;Herbal&rdquo;
    Medicine May Not Be HERBAL!</b></span><br />
  <span style='
'>The Chinese may be trying to clean up their act,
    when it comes to Political Freedom and Human Rights, but when it comes to
    cleaning up their herbal medicine, they fail. Traditional Chinese Medicine,
    like many traditional medicines, may contain many wonderful herbs. But I want
    you to know that their traditional medicine <b>also contains</b> many disgusting, rotten, bacteria laden and toxic
    ingredients.</span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-family:
Arial;'>Traditional Chinese <i>Herbal</i> Medicine
    has been practiced for thousands of years and still today, many species of
    animals are being tortured and killed for their superstitious potions and
    voodoo remedies.</span></b></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
style=''>One of
    the most popular Los Angeles area Chinese <i>Herbal</i> Stores, not a Chinese
    store in Chinatown, but a new age very hip Chinese Herbal Store on the Westside
    of LA… well here is what they consider herbal. In their <b><i><u>herbal </u></i></b>tonics I found <b>animal sexual organs, gecko
    lizards, deer antler, placenta, tortoise shell, fish, caterpillar fungus and
    pearls.</b> Quoting from their <i>Herbal</i> Tonics catalog it says, &ldquo;<i>this formula contains over 40 <u>HERBS</u>,
    three of which are <b>male animal sexual organs</b></i>&rdquo;. Later on it states &ldquo;<i>supertonic <u>HERBS</u> such as <b><u>deer antler</u></b></i>&rdquo; and it calls &ldquo;<b><i><u>pearl</u></i></b><i>, a very special <u>HERBAL</u> substance</i>&rdquo;. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b><span
style=''>I do not
    consider animal sexual organs, deer antler and pearls to be HERBS! </span></b></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
style=''>Other stores I visited in Chinatown sold musk
    extracted from deer testicles and snake cream from cobras that were <i>skinned
    alive. </i>I also found bear gall bladders, bear bile and bear paws and you
    should be aware that <b>many California bear have been found lying dead in the
    forest with their gall bladders cut out and their paws chopped off, and their
    body was just mutilated and dumped in the woods while their parts were being
    shipped to China. Other American bears have been found chained in cages, <u>still
    alive</u>, with drain tubes inserted into their livers to collect their bile.</b></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b><span
style=''>Animals
    are being butchered all over the world for so-called Chinese &ldquo;<i>Herbal</i>&rdquo; Medicine and because of the
    Chinese, Tigers and the Rhinoceros are now extinct in the wild.</span></b></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
style=''>The
    Chinese claim that by eating the <b>penis of Tigers</b> men can regain their
    sexual stamina and prowess. It is one of the most sought after Chinese <b>&ldquo;<i>herbal</i></b>&rdquo;<b> </b>tonics. People
    always hope for the shortcuts to health. Men all over the world would rather
    believe eating a <b>tiger’s penis</b> <span class=GramE>will</span> give them
    an erection instead of just getting healthy. The <b>tiger’s bones</b> are
    believed to help arthritis, the <b>tiger’s nose</b> is used for epilepsy and
    seizures and even the <b>tiger’s whiskers</b> are used for toothache. <b>Because of this ongoing poaching of
    endangered species, tigers are almost extinct.</b></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
style=''>While
    Chinese Herbal shops swear they don’t sell tiger parts, they do. In a trip to
    Chinatown in San Francisco 45 herbal shops were visited. Of the 45, 32 of them <span>had illegal tiger parts, that’s</span> over 50%. One shop had
    entire tiger skeletons and tiger skins.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
style=''>Because
    tiger parts are getting harder to acquire, the Chinese &ldquo;<i>herbalists</i>&rdquo;<i> </i>have turned to rhinoceros
    horns hoping that these horns might have the same supposed sexual stimulating
    and erection creating powers as the tiger penis. (Simply because the horn
    resembles an erect penis) <b>Because of
    this, <span class=GramE>rhinoceros have been slaughtered by the thousands all
    over Africa, some even shot by helicopter gun ships strafing the herds</span>.
    T</b>hen trucks coming by land afterwards, sawing off the horn and then leaving
    the entire rhino dying on the ground. In efforts to stop the slaughter many
    African countries have dehorned the rhinos, to save their lives, but the
    poachers are still killing them just to dig the stump of the horn out.</span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:135%;'>Chinese Medicines: Heavy Karma and
    Heavy METAL too!</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>For years we have been hearing more and more about chemical
    contamination in modern prescription chemical Chinese medicine, (even recently
    toxic Chinese Drywall) and also chemical contamination in the Chinese &ldquo;herbal&rdquo;
    medicine. I have warned you about using Chinese herbs because they are dirty,
    often contaminated with human waste, animal waste and parts, DDT and other
    toxic insecticides and pesticides and now even heavy metals. I have also warned
    you about Chinese Patent &ldquo;HERBAL&rdquo; Medicines that are often sold as pure
    &ldquo;herbal&rdquo; medicine but have been found to contain pharmaceutical drugs. <b>The Chinese commonly mix both herbs and
    pharmaceutical drugs in their medicines, and also often include toxic substances,
    even heavy metals.</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>American medical doctors love heavy metals too. Often American medical
    doctors inject gold into arthritis patients, and have used arsenic as an
    antibiotic. In fact highly toxic Platinum is used in chemotherapy with lots of
    side effects. Dentists’ still use mercury amalgam to fill tooth cavities even
    though it is linked to a thousand diseases and health problems while drug
    manufacturers still use mercury to preserve baby inoculations, which has led to
    many birth defects.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>The Chinese are no different, they just don’t have the big division
    between medical / pharmaceutical and natural / herbal, they just mix it all
    together in one cocktail.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Chinese Herbal and Traditional Medicines are now sold outside of New
    York and San Francisco Chinatowns, and are available in many supermarkets, drug
    stores and health food stores across America. According to a recent
    examination, 10% of traditional Chinese medicines contained lead, 15% arsenic,
    15% mercury and over 20% contained unlisted pharmaceutical drugs and 20%
    contained unlabeled, potentially harmful ingredients.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Many of these medicines have been banned for years in many European
    nations and in many meetings I have attended of European Herbal Medicine
    organizations, they want to boycott ALL Chinese herbs because so many Chinese
    herbal products are mixed with chemical pharmaceutical drugs, heavy metals,
    stinking rotten animal parts, reptile and insect parts and other toxic
    substances.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>In America, people have died from ingesting Chinese medicines. Most
    people who get sick are poisoned slowly over a few years and then hospitals and
    doctors often don’t link it to the toxic preparation until it is too late.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>The bottom line is that I have always promoted my patients to &ldquo;live
    under their own Fig Tree&rdquo;. Meaning to live locally and eat food that is locally
    grown and in season.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>It would be ridiculous to think that all of the strong, effective and
    good herbs grow in China, India, or some far off exotic place. We eat American
    food, grown locally and in season, so it only makes sense to consume American
    herbs for our medicine. </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>All the herbs we need for our health grow right here in the United
    States, many right in your own backyard. These are the best ones for us, for
    people living in the same environment; these herbs are more geographically fit
    for us. We should also be supporting American organic farmers and their
    families </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Traditional Chinese Medicine is thousands of years old, we may have a
    lot to learn from it, but I wouldn’t let any of my patients put this dangerous,
    toxic, bacteria laden crap in their mouths or bodies and I suggest you don’t
    either<b>. </b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Let me take this a few steps further. <b>I propose a 100% boycott on any type of Chinese medicine, even Chinese
    Herbal Medicine products, until they stop butchering California Black Bears,
    STOP cutting the penis off tigers, STOP shooting and dehorning Rhinoceros by
    helicopter, STOP selling snakes, shark fins, testicle fluid, insects and rotten
    eggs and calling it herbs…</b></span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>…<span>and</span> STOP dehydrating and powdering up HUMAN BABIES!&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>&#8212;&nbsp;Dr.
    Schulze</span></b></p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=''>Last week I wrote a commentary, to warn all of my BLOG
readers, mainly that Chinese &ldquo;<i>Herbal&rdquo;</i>
Medicine, <i>as it is almost always called, </i><b>often contains a lot more than just herbs!</b>
I want to thank all those that wrote me thanking me for my report. My sole
purpose was not to condemn any traditional medicine, nor the Chinese, but to
simply expose the ugly truth, so that you are all aware what is being sold as
&ldquo;herbs&rdquo;.</span></p>

<p><span style=''>I only received one single negative hate/e-mail, only one,
from a Chinese person. Normally I don’t bother to respond to one unique e-mail,
I respond to questions that all of us can learn from, so that is really what I
am doing here. </span></p>

<p><span style=''>I don’t really care if this person wants &ldquo;off my list&rdquo; or
not. <b>What I do care about is your
health, and you being able to heal yourself naturally using herbal medicine, </b>my
point being <i>herbal</i>, and my point
really being your health education.<b>
After all, the whole point of this BLOG is so you can make better and more
informed health and healing choices and decisions.</b></span></p>

<p><span style=''>So the following response is not really a response to Ryu,
but a continued lesson in <b>Herbal Clarity</b>
for all of us. A huge part of my clinical work, and now my educational work, is<b> illuminating my patients and followers to
what they are putting into their mouth; food, drink, pharmaceutical medicine <i>and even herbal medicine. </i></b></span></p>

<p><span style=''>Even if someone does not care about consuming deer antlers,
caterpillar fungus, insects, and dead animal organs, and much worse, <b>it just doesn’t make good sense to use <i>natural </i>medicine and herbs from the
other side of the planet.</b> When this planet was created, all the good herbs
were not put on the other side far away from us. There are medicinal herbs over
the entire planet, <b>and it is best for
all of us to learn how to use what is growing right in our own backyards</b>,
especially in time of crisis or when the delivery truck gets a flat tire.
Exotic is not better, it is just… exotic.</span></p>

<p><span style=''>This week I will also deviate from my usual format and
answer this reader’s comments right in their letter, one paragraph at a time,
so it is easier for you to understand what I am teaching.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><span style='color:red'>I'm taking myself off of your list
right now.</span></i></b></p>

<p><span style=''>Years ago I decided that my absolute focus, being a doctor,
and especially being an outspoken natural doctor, was one thing. <b>To help people to heal themselves, and stay
healthy, <i>naturally</i>.</b> It was not to
win a popularity contest. I realized over 40 years ago, that if I were to speak
the truth, that I would anger 10%, maybe even 20% of my readers, <i>(in this case it seems it was only 1 / 1,000,000%)</i>.
Anyway, to me, in order to give you my best of what I have learned in my
lifelong journey into natural medicine, <b>what
I tell you may not always be the most politically correct or socially correct,
and it won’t be watered down, designed to be polite or digestible to the masses.</b>
So I will lose some readers <i>and customers</i>
along the way. So be it! I’ve always said if people don’t want to hear the
truth, I can always go off the grid and retire. I’m happy to say that so far,
I’m not retiring any time soon! </span></p>

<p><b><i><span style='color:red'>As a Taiwanese/Chinese-American who
has lived in the U.S. for 30+ years of my life, I found your article on Chinese
medicine offensive.</span></i></b></p>

<p><span style=''>I will never get this hyphen-American thing. Sure, it is
important to remember our roots, but give me a break. African-American, okay,
because their ancestors were kidnapped, beaten, brought to America against
their will and enslaved. So if they want to distinguish themselves from the
rest of us who immigrated, or from our parents who emigrated on their own free
will, or use the hyphen for their years of oppression and cruelty, or for
whatever reason, so be it. <i>(So brothers
and sisters, take your time and use the hyphen as long as you want)</i></span></p>

<p><span style=''>But immigrants, forget about it. If you have been living
here for 30 plus years, <i>and I am assuming
you weren’t kidnapped or enslaved,</i> then you’re an American. I am not saying
love it or leave it here; I am saying <i>get
with the program</i>. What makes America the greatest country in the world is
our diversity, and the fact that 99% of us came from somewhere else, to make a
better life for ourselves and our families. My family came from Germany, but I
never refer to myself as a German-American. Hyphens are a separatist movement
and I’m for all of us dropping the limited access bullshit and getting along. <i></i></span></p>

<p><span style=''>So if you’re a citizen, you can drop the Chinese part. If
you’re not, become one, and drop the Chinese part! </span></p>

<p><b><i><span style='color:red'>Chinese herbs come from a wide variety
of sources and even within the Traditional Chinese Medicine community there are
folks fighting to give up the use of endangered animals in medicine.&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>

<p><span style=''>You still don’t get it! You say Chinese herbs come from a
wide variety of sources, proving my point. <b>If
the source isn’t a plant, then it is NOT an HERB!</b></span></p>

<p><span style=''>I am aware that some Chinese are fighting to clean up their
act, and I applaud the Chinese who are trying to upgrade and modernize their
traditional medicine.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, never
the less, it still exists! </span></p>

<p><span style=''>So let me try to set you straight here, once and for all. <b>My point is that the name Traditional
Chinese &ldquo;Herbal&rdquo; Medicine, is a big fat lie. </b>It should just be referred to
as Traditional Chinese Medicine. <b>And
they need to STOP referring to non-plant material ingredients as herbal!</b></p>
<p>I will repeat from last week's Blog, statement's taken from a Chinese Herbal Product catalog sitting right on my desk:<i> &ldquo;This formula contains over 40 <u>HERBS</u>, three of which are<b> male animal sexual organs</b>&rdquo;</i>. Later on it states <i>&ldquo;supertonic <u>HERBS</u> such as <b><u>deer antler</u>&rdquo;</b></i> and it calls <b><i>&ldquo;<u>pearl</u>,</b> a very special <u>HERBAL</u> substance&rdquo;</i>.</p>
<p>Almost
all Traditional medicines, even American Indian, were loaded with lots of
animal guts, insects and god knows what else, basically using anything that
grew, ran, flew, swam or crawled. Traditional Chinese medicine is a great
example of this. Lets go to the dictionary here, the AMERICAN dictionary.</p>

<p><b><span
style=''>HERB, from
Webster’s <u>AMERICAN</u> Dictionary!</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>1:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><span>a</span><span> <b><u>plant</u></b>
or <b><u>plant part</u></b> valued for it’s
medicinal, savory, or aromatic qualities</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:center;'><b><u><span style='font-size:165%;'>HERB means a PLANT! PERIOD!</span></u></b><b><u><span></span></u></b></p>

<p><i><span
style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></p>

<p><b><i><span style='color:red'>When you constantly say, &ldquo;the
Chinese this... the Chinese that…&rdquo; you are attributing an entire group
of people to the horrible practice of including human parts and other
disgusting things in these pills.</span></i></b></p>

<p><span style=''>I have NEVER walked into ANY Chinese Herbal Store, selling
herbs or herbal tonics or herbal medicines, whether traditional or new age or
modern, that didn’t sell <b>deer antlers</b>,
cordycepts or <b>fungus off the heads of
caterpillars</b>, <b>dried fish</b>, <b>insects</b> and all sorts of weird stuff
that simply IS NOT HERBAL and didn’t smell like death. And, I want to make
everyone aware that these substances are being called herbal, and sold as PLANT
material! They are not PLANT materials!</span></p>

<p><span style=''>I have also been warning people for decades about
Homeopathy, a system of medicine that also lies and sells itself as being
herbal medicine, when it is not. Yes, they also use herbs, but additionally
they use hundreds of very disgusting and toxic substances like lead, arsenic,
animal pus, ground bugs… the list is long. Their popular remedy
Oscillococcinum, promoted for colds and flu, that most people think is herbal,
is actually made from ground up duck livers and mashed duck hearts. By the way,
Homeopathy was invented a few hundred years ago by a German <b>medical doctor</b>, not an herbal doctor.
Again, Homeopathy, like Chinese Medicine, does use herbs, but also uses
hundreds of other very toxic and disgusting things. By the way, I will write
about Homeopathy in a few weeks.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span style='color:red'>It is deeply offensive.</span></i></b></p>

<p><span style=''>Sometimes the truth is offensive! What I find <i>&ldquo;deeply offensive&rdquo;</i> is anyone selling
animal parts, insect parts, fish parts and deer antler, and calling it Herbal
Medicine!</span></p>

<p><b><i><span style='color:red'>Just like there is a wide variety of
sources for &ldquo;American&rdquo; herbs, so it is with any other broad
category.&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>

<p><span style=''>I am NOT aware of anyone selling American Herbs, American
Herbal Tonics or American Herbal Medicines that is blending in deer antler,
animal guts, bugs and non-herbal material. If you are, please let me know.</span></p>

<p><i><span
style=''><b><span
style='color:red'>It really comes across as, shall we say, RACIST.</span></b></span></i></p>

<p><span style=''>&ldquo;It&rdquo;, I think you mean me here, that &ldquo;I&rdquo; come across as
racist. I would not be afraid to tell you if I was a racist, but I am NOT a
racist, actually far from it. After my parents died, I grew up in a Japanese
Dojo and have spent most of my life studying the martial arts. Most of my
teachers and friends in this art are Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Filipino.
In fact I am sure I know more about oriental medicine than you. I’m just a man
who calls an herb, an herb and doesn’t believe we have to torture and kill any
animals to make medicine.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span style='color:red'>Forget it.&nbsp; With all the
nutritional healing guru&rsquo;s out there the last thing I need is this slanderous
propaganda.&nbsp;Have a good time catering to your &ldquo;American&rdquo;
audience.</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><span style='
color:red'>Ryu C.<span style=''>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>San
Francisco, CA</span><span style='color:red'></span></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><span style='color:red'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p><span style=''>I am having a good time!</span></p>

<p><span style=''>And I am having a good time catering to my American
audience!</span></p>

<p><span style=''>And catering to my audience all over the world for that
matter, because I get e-mails from every country out there!</span></p>

<p><span style=''>In closing, I invite you, you Chinese-Americans, all people
from all the different cultures around the world, and all Native American
people and all you Homeopaths too; to abandon the dark force and move into the
light, and embrace a system of healing and medicine that does not rely on the
torture and killing of any animals, or bugs. It’s 2012 my friend, clean,
healthy, potent VEGAN HERBAL MEDICINE is where its at!</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><b><span
style='font-size:135%'>Bigger is
    NOT Necessarily Better</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>The growing
    trend over the last few decades seems to be the almost endless selling by owners
    of their  small companies to huge international corporations. I wouldn't mind
    this trend, if I thought it was in the customers’ best interest, and
    furthermore, if what I experienced was that the products got better. Instead,
    what I almost always see is that the products get worse. This trend is usually
    NOT in the consumers’ best interest at all.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Usually,
    when small companies sell out, the founder’s passion, vision and purity gets
    lost, as the new parent company focuses on cost, bottom lines, larger
    distribution and even larger profits. This results in their quest to make the
    products cheaper, and results in inferior products that don’t work as well,
    don't last as long, and  are more disposable. </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Recycled
    has even become <i>Recyclable</i>, the new
    product buzzword, which doesn’t mean anything. Actually, it means that the
    company didn't do a damn thing in sourcing out their raw materials, didn't use
    anything recycled, and they're just asking you to take on what is <i>their</i> <i>responsibility</i> and dispose of the product in a conscious way, if
    this is even possible. </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>I still
    have my father's tools, and some of these tools were his father's tools. Steel,
    iron and wood, <i>and with a little oil, </i>the
    oldest tools still work like the day they were made. You can’t buy tools like
    this anymore. Half the screwdrivers I buy nowadays, strip just using them to
    screw in a screw, <i>if the plastic handle
    doesn’t break first</i>. They just don't make things like they used to. OK, I
    could bitch about this forever, and I’m starting to scare myself because I’m
    sounding like my father, so I’ll get to my point…</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:135%'>The
    Corporate Buyout of our Health</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>No, I’m not
    talking about HMO’s, but that’s another thing that didn’t improve medical care,
    but it did improve insurance companies’ profits. <b>I am talking about the selling of health businesses and herbal medicine
    companies to big corporations.</b></span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Coca Cola </span></b><span
style=''>bought out Odwalla juice. That was a
    nightmare. Their bad processes made people sick and caused pasteurization laws
    to be passed so now we can only buy cooked apple juice.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Pepsi Cola </span></b><span
style=''>bought out Naked Juice, so now most
    of our fresh juices are being produced by Coke, Pepsi and other soda pop
    companies.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Kraft Foods</span></b><span
style=''>, the people who make Velveeta
    imitation cheese, bought out Boca Burger, the veggie burger company, and that
    quality went down. (By the way, Kraft Foods is owned by tobacco giant Phillip
    Morris.)</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Lipton</span></b><span
style=''>, the huge black tea company,<b> </b>bought out Celestial Seasonings Herbal
    Teas, and we got prettier packaging, not better product!</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Mars Incorporated, </span></b><span
style=''>the huge candy bar company
    (M&amp;M’s and Snickers), bought out <i>what
    used to be an awesome</i> Organic seed and food company, Seeds of Change. </span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Traditional Medicinal Teas</span></b><span
style=''> &#8211; SOLD and is no longer owned
    by the great California herbalist Rosemary Gladstar anymore. In fact, I just
    searched for her name on their corporate website and nothing came back!</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Janet Zand’s</span></b><span
style=''> herbal products &#8211; SOLD and is
    no longer owned by Janet anymore. (By the way, I couldn’t find her name on the
    company website anymore, either.)</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Burt’s Bees </span></b><span
style=''>&#8211;&nbsp;SOLD to Clorox.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Get my point here? The Soda Pop, Candy
    Bar and Junk Food industries are taking over our Health Food Industry!</span></b></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:135%'>Am I
    Paranoid?</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>During the
    days of my clinic, I used to feel like the government was closing in on
    me&#8212;<i>actually it did!</i> Today,
    corporate giants have surrounded and are circling the health wagon train, and
    are picking off my friends, students and the health food industry in general,
    one by one. </span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>(OK, in fairness let’s not blame
    corporate giants, they make health-destroying junk, but this is not their
    fault. It is actually the pure greed of my friends, students and the health
    food industry people, that are selling their companies, and their souls, for
    the almighty dollar! They are selling the natural foods and natural medicines
    we made to combat the damage caused by the health-destroying products of these
    big corporations, TO THE SAME CORPORATIONS!!!)</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>I would
    love to believe that this trend is the beginning of a new era, and awakening of
    American corporations, that Americans want health, and are willing to take more
    responsibility. My fear is that in this process, of all my students and other
    herbalists selling their businesses to drug companies and horrible corrupt
    earth and animal destroying companies, well, these once good products will
    become trendy names with good packaging, wider distribution, <i>but the quality will degenerate to total
    garbage! </i>Actually, it is more than a fear, it is happening!</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:135%'>Another
    One Bites the Dust!</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>In my life
    I have had the privilege to teach many great men and women who have gone on to
    become great herbal doctors and run great clinics. Other people I have trained
    have gone into the health food and herbal medicine industry. Many years ago, I
    was fortunate enough to teach two east coast friends, Paul Schulick and Rick <span
class=SpellE>Scalzo</span>. Paul <span class=SpellE>Schulick</span> went on to
    create New Chapter, a natural vitamin supplement company, and Rick Scalzo
    founded Gaia Herbs, a very good herbal company.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:125%'>In The News This Week:</span></b></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Paul Schulick has just sold his
    natural vitamin supplement company to Proctor &amp; Gamble!</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>Proctor &amp;
    Gamble:</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>- The
    makers of Crisco, the original crystallized cottonseed oil <b>supplying Americans with a daily dose of health-destroying trans-fatty
    acids for 100 years now</b>.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>- The
    makers of Pepto Bismol, basically liquid aspirin.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>- The
    makers of Tide, its heavy duty earth polluting synthetic detergent.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>- The
    makers of Crest, and the original fluoride toothpaste.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>And let’s
    not forget Pringles and Prilosec! Yes, Proctor &amp; Gamble makes “over the
    counter” pharmaceuticals too!</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>There have
    been many websites that have made great comments on this sell out by New
    Chapter to Proctor &amp; Gamble.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:125%'>Excerpts from a few other recent
    Blogs, Regarding the Sell Out…</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>Spread
    the word: New Chapter is now owned by Proctor &amp; Gamble.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>Proctor
    &amp; Gamble, the global corporate conglomerate that sells a vast array of
    consumer products containing cancer-causing chemicals and petroleum
    derivatives, is now the proud owner of <b>New Chapter</b>, one of the more
    promising nutritional supplement companies we've seen in a while.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>New
    Chapter co-founder Paul Schulick announced, &quot;For us, this has been a dream
    come true. This is what we have been wanting to do since we started doing this
    30 years ago. The world and the United States need this.&quot;</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>Really?
    The world needs global corporate giants to buy up all the natural product
    brands? This is one of the many companies we helped publicize and promote, only
    to see them sell out to corporate giants who routinely take over these
    companies, cheapen their product formulations, and exploit name recognition to
    intentionally mislead consumers into buying watered-down, reformulated
    products.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><b><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>So now
    the same company that brings you Tide laundry detergent, Pringles potato chips,
    Dawn dishwashing soap, and Bounce dryer sheets (can you even think of a more
    offensive chemical laundry product?) will be bringing you New Chapter
    supplements, too.</span></i></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>I'm
    disappointed in New Chapter and Paul Schulick. Here's yet another case of
    someone who has sold out to the global power elite, apparently oblivious to
    where this will likely lead.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>Paul
    Schulick has made a deal with that devil, it seems.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>Of
    course, I'm sure Paul has justified it all to himself. The huge financial
    backing of P&amp;G will allow New Chapter to &quot;expand into more retail
    outlets,&quot; he's probably told himself. The deal will show P&amp;G that
    natural products can be profitable! It will make nutrition mainstream! Yeah,
    right.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>These
    stories always have the same ending: The products get watered down, consumers
    shift their demand to a smaller, trusted company, and the financials of the
    once-great small company collapse. The big corporation ends up either
    shuttering it or whoring it out using the same brand name but replacing all the
    quality ingredients with crap filler and toxic chemicals. The only
    &quot;winner&quot; in these deals is usually the CEO who sold it, and possibly
    a few board members who also walk away with millions of dollars while their
    customers who made them great get left with nothing.</span></i></p>

    Chapter, a vitamin and supplement company offering worthy products since 1982,
    has recently been
    bought out by mega-corporation Proctor &amp; Gamble. Being the owner
    of chemical laden, toxic products such as Cascade dish-washing soap, Tide
    laundry detergent, Pringles
    potato chips, and Bounce dryer sheets, it is evident that Proctor
    &amp; Gamble is less than a trustworthy and caring company. </span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>Although
    Schulick’s stated goal of offering the world quality health supplements free of
    health-damaging substances&nbsp;is commendable, <b>is seeking and accepting the involvement of a corrupt corporate giant really acceptable?</b> The quality of
    New Chapter’s products will undoubtedly be compromised by such a corporate
    fuse, with P&amp;G’s poor record of health-devastating products enough to raise
    the alarm<b>. Truthfully, the teaming up of
    nutritional supplement companies and corporations like P&amp;G is the last thing the world and United
    States needs.</b></span></i></p>

    &amp; Gamble, the corporate conglomerate which recently bought out organic
    supplement and vitamin company New Chapter, has a long and extensive history of
    engaging in cruel animal testing…. and has been lying for years about making
    efforts to switch to cruelty-free testing alternatives.</span></i></p>

    continues to torture dogs, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, and other creatures
    by conducting experiments on them that include poisoning them with toxins,
    burning their eyes with chemicals, and eventually killing them, and P&amp;G
    does not even provide basic care for these animals while they are still alive.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>P&amp;G
    ‘scientists’ do not sedate the animals or give them painkillers when they place
    the animals in restraining devices so they cannot struggle while the workers
    apply the chemicals, which burn into the animals' eyes and skin, where the
    animals sometimes break their necks or backs attempting to escape the pain. </span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='font-size:90%;color:#B5101A;'>P&amp;G’s
    animal torture includes forcing dogs to eat large amounts of cleaning chemicals
    by pumping them directly into their stomachs.</span></i></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style=''><span style=''>Friends,</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>Last week I responded to Lisa M’s
    question about my <b>SuperFood Plus,</b> and some things she read about it on a website. I mainly responded to her about
    her faith, and how important it is for all of us to listen to our inner voice,
    and follow this voice. Whether you call it intuition or the voice of God within
    you, ALWAYS follow your inner voice. And this is especially important in
    Healing Yourself!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>But I also responded to her to let her
    know that most of what was written on the website she saw was either incorrect
    or immature. And then seized the opportunity, <i>not to defend my product,</i> but to explain to my readers why and how
    I make it (as I get many questions like this) and what my priorities and focus
    are when making it. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>Then, almost immediately, I received a
    response email from Jonathan Bechtel, the man who actually published the
    incorrect facts and immature comments regarding my <b>SuperFood Plus</b> on his website. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>His letter was so sincere, I decided to
    print it this week, and I commend him for writing it. Since I don’t respond to
    people directly, I will add some responses to him right in his letter.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>&#8212;&nbsp;Dr. Schulze</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>This is the letter I received, <b>and my responses to this gentleman are in
    BOLD</b>…</span></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Hi Dr. Schulze! &nbsp;</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>This is Jonathan Bechtel from Health Kismet. &nbsp;I just read your
    blog post about the review I wrote on your Superfood product.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>First off<span class=GramE>........</span>when I first wrote the
    review, <b>I made quite a few editorial
    errors which were stupid on my part.</b> &nbsp;Your fans did an excellent job
    of pointing these out to me.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>They were:</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>1). The details about the nutritional information on your product.
    &nbsp;Whether or not they are synthetic/natural, etc.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>As
    I stated last week, all of the nutritional information on my SuperFood Plus
    label is derived from what is NATURALLY present in the foods and herbs, in the
    SuperFood Plus. No synthetic vitamins are added. Just Super Nutritional Foods
    and Super Nutritional Herbs. So thanks for recognizing this.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>2). &nbsp;Not respecting the brand you've built for yourself with
    your honest work. &nbsp;I should have been more careful to portray your
    Superfood Plus in a constructive light and highlight how it most benefits
    people.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>I
    agree, but you are younger than me, and I too made such mistakes when I was
    younger. Please do not beat yourself up about this at all. I did the same to a
    few of my teachers when I was much younger. But I meant what I said about you
    in my BLOG last week, when I said:</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>“</span></b><b><span
style=''>I
    liked most all of what he says on his website. </span></b><b><span style=''>He seems to be an energetic young man with a sincere desire to help
    people.” </span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>And
    now after reading the letter you just sent to me, I believe even more in my
    assessment of you.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>3). &nbsp;In my entrepreneurial career thus far (about 1 year strong<b>) I think that picture I took of myself
    (making a face when taking my SuperFood Plus), is the single most embarrassing
    thing I've ever done.</b> I've had a lot of failures (and a few successes!) <b>but few things that I believe were
    categorically stupid, and that <span class=GramE>was</span> one of them.</b></span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Again
    Jonathan, don’t be too hard on <span class=GramE>yourself</span>. Yeah, I think
    it was a stupid thing to do too. Just so you know where I am coming from… </span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>I
    spent decades running my clinic dealing with very ill patients dying from all
    sorts of horrific diseases that were literally eating them alive. Often their
    flesh was rotting off, smelling horrible, bleeding and infected, they were
    suffocating, going blind, etc. They were dying from all sorts of horrible
    diseases when they crawled into my clinic. Furthermore, they had also been
    tortured by the medical profession, burnt with radiation, poisoned by chemical
    drugs and chemotherapy, maimed and disfigured by surgery. And, once all of
    their money was gone, they were then tossed away by the medical profession, and
    now they were crawling up the stairs of my clinic, almost dead. I want you to
    imagine this picture.<u></u></span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>I
    was making herbal formulae (probably before you were born) to literally save
    their lives. I used my SuperFood Plus along with the juicer to build their
    blood up so they wouldn’t die from anemia before my other herbal tonics had a
    chance to kick in. So taste was never even considered. Surviving was the only
    factor.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Now
    I still disagree with you about the taste of my SuperFood Plus. I love it and
    so do my customers. To me it is <span class=GramE>an excellent</span> popcorn
    seasoning as well as a great sprinkle onto almost any dish, like rice and
    veggies. But taste is acquired, and to anyone who is used to junk food and
    sugar, and not vegetables and live food, well, my SuperFood Plus may take a
    little getting used to.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>So with regards to these three issues<span class=GramE>.....</span>honestly,
    honestly, honestly........I'm sorry my business learning curve had to come at
    the expense of your online reputation. &nbsp;You've obviously earned your
    success, <b>and to be honest I aspire to
    follow in your footsteps</b> (in one way or another), not to rake you through
    the mud.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Apology
    absolutely accepted! Although I forgave you before you even wrote this letter.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>And
    don’t worry at all, about my online reputation. I decided years ago that in
    order to get my message across, that I would offend a few people. I am NOT for
    everyone. I am a doctor, I come from the clinic, and as I said before, my
    patients were dying horrible painful deaths. My job was to keep them alive, and
    help them create their own Healing Miracles, NOT <span class=GramE>be</span> politically correct. You will see this in a reader’s comment I will post after
    my response to you.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>For What Its Worth, the<b> editorial mistakes I made were apparent sometime ago and I rewrote the review at
    my own discretion.</b> &nbsp;I'm not sure if you've since seen it, but I
    believe it doesn't contain anything that you wouldn't agree with. &nbsp;If
    there IS something that's not factually accurate then please let me know.
    &nbsp;I'm not looking to pick a fight.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Well
    done. I then suggest you go back and remove your old work if you feel it is
    incorrect.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Just
    remember what both of our companies are ALL ABOUT&#8212;Helping People Get
    Well&#8212;and NEVER lose sight of that goal. </span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Jonathan,
    if you remain focused on Helping People to Heal Themselves, then everything you
    do will be good! This is the focus that absolutely drives me (and now my
    company), which is easier for me to see and remain focused on, because I can
    close my eyes and still see a few of the patients that didn’t make it in my
    clinic, especially the kids. This will haunt me forever, and I transform this
    haunting into positive energy to ALWAYS do my absolute best!</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>This
    is why I will now urge you to start a clinic, and start seeing patients. You
    don’t need any degree or any license, you have some experience and a flair and
    passion for natural healing and natural living, so start helping people, start
    guiding people. You have plenty of knowledge to start, and you will gain your
    real knowledge once you start dealing with patients. There is no shortage of
    sick people out there that need your help.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>You're characterization of <span class=GramE>me and my company</span> is about right. <span class=GramE>New, bootstrapped, climbing the mountain but
    not yet on top of it.</span> &nbsp;But I do believe it has the chance to be
    something unique and very useful.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>I'm agreeable and polite by nature, but I don't think most people
    would describe me as a pussy. &nbsp;(Even though I make the occasional
    egregious mistake). &nbsp;You'd probably like me as a patient.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>OK,
    now you're sounding better to me, but talk is cheap. Again, I suggest that you
    start seeing <span class=GramE>patients,</span> this is where you will do your
    real learning. I think now you can see it from my perspective, a young guy
    making faces and whining about the taste of what I think is the finest,
    natural, herbal, nutritional, vegan and organic nutritional supplement
    available.<span style='color:red'> </span>Regardless of how you think it
    tastes, in the clinic, I saw it save thousands of lives literally bringing
    people back from the dead.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>For What It’s Worth, Incredible Greens is manufactured in an FDA
    approved facility and not in my bathtub. &nbsp;Would you mind correcting that?</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>I
    never said bathtub, I said kitchen, which I do not think is a derogatory
    statement simply because that was where my clinical laboratory was, where I
    made all of my patients’ herbal medicines, and also where my original “start
    up” manufacturing took place. In fact, still today, this is where most of my
    personal research and development takes place&#8212;in my home, in my kitchen,
    with my Champion juicer, my Vita Mix, my food dehydrator, etc.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>You're right that my product is not organic.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>This
    is where I am going to nudge you Jonathan, to get you with the program.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Organic
    foods contain 4 to 10 times more nutrition; that’s more vitamins and minerals.
    Organic herbs contain 4 to 10 times higher concentrations of phyto-chemicals or
    herbal chemicals that create the healings. So for the sake of your customers,
    GO ORGANIC.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Furthermore,
    in the 1960’s we had a saying, “You are either part of the Solution, or you are
    part of the Problem, there is NO MIDDLE PATH”. If you are NOT using Organic,
    Jonathan, then YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM. </span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>The
    foods you are selling people are sprayed with insecticides, herbicides, have
    residues of synthetic chemical fertilizers, and then gassed with highly toxic, carcinogenic
    and mutagenic antibacterial agents. It just does not make sense to try and help
    people get well, <i>and then POISON them at
    the same time. </i></span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Furthermore
    again, even if the toxic residues in your products are not a concern to you or
    your customers, the growing of your non-organic ingredients is pouring billions
    of tons of poisons back onto the earth, where we live. So again, you are making
    your customers sick in both ways.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Jonathan,
    I will not let up on this one. EVERY piece of food that comes into my house is
    ORGANIC. It’s 2012, not 1970, and there is absolutely no excuse for you not to
    be buying organic ingredients and using them, for your customers, the planet,
    everybody! So until you go organic, you are part of the problem. OK, I guess
    that was more than a nudge! </span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>I
    want you&#8212;I need you&#8212;to not be a few steps below me, but to rise
    above me. Since I took all of my teachers work and seriously upgraded it, I
    expect you to do the same. Open a clinic, and take Natural Healing and Herbal
    Medicine to the highest level you possibly can!</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>My blog didn't receive very much attention when I wrote it but
    things have obviously changed since then. &nbsp;I'll make sure to be more
    careful.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style=''>Again
    Jonathan, Focus on Helping People to Heal Themselves, then you won’t make these
    mistakes again.</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>All the best,</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='color:red'>&#8212;&nbsp;Jonathan</span></i></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Now
    a few more fun comments from my readers…</span></b></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:135%;'>A
    Reader That Doesn’t Like<br />That
    I Used the Word PUSSY</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>&nbsp;I am writing this note today to respond to your latest blog post
    entitled, “Is SuperFood Plus Natural? Herbal Nutrition 101.”</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>I object to you insulting others by calling the man in question “a
    pussy.”</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Furthermore, I demand that you explain to your readers why you chose
    to use the word “pussy” as it also contains a connotation that can be perceived
    quite degrading to women, despite the fact the expression actually refers to
    the nature of the feline species being afraid or cowardly. Nonetheless, why do
    you employ this word? What does using this word as a weapon do for you?</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>And in the future, please, I implore you - - consider finding words
    in your vocabulary that actually articulate what you mean to say. And then
    consider whether you really should say them, and then publish them on the
    Internet... &nbsp;</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>I will not support a company that insults others, or calls other
    people &quot;a pussy&quot; for any reason, under any circumstances, period.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>I&nbsp;am disgusted by your actions and words and am requesting you
    edit your post and apologize to those who've attempted to diminish or harm.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>&nbsp;A long-time customer and supporter of your business,</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>&#8212;&nbsp;Lisa J. in Los Angeles, CA</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>Dear Lisa, </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>Wow, Lisa, you have a big button here
    and I would safely guess it is not with me. I suggest you get some
    psychotherapy, heal past issues or learn 1,000 jokes, actually why not do all
    three? And since your big deal is with the word pussy, maybe you even need to
    pay some additional attention to Chapter 18 of my 20 Steps Book, on More Sex!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>My focus is and has always been, to
    help people heal themselves of any and all diseases, using Natural Healing and
    Herbal Medicine, period!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>I learned in my clinic, that when
    people are dying, they can’t hear very well, their mind is foggy (usually from
    all the fear, pain, and chemical drugs). Often they need a good kick in the
    ass. Over the years I have discovered that using a few choice words usually
    gets people’s attention, like it did yours. After all, their life is at stake! </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>One day you may be real sick, and you
    will be lucky to find a doctor like me that will kick your ass if you need it
    kicked, and then you will know why I occasionally throw in a word like pussy,
    and you will appreciate me more.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>Sorry if I lose you as a customer, but
    since my focus is to help people heal themselves of disease, I will not change
    who I am or how I express myself for anyone who is allergic to my vocabulary,
    because, like in your case, of some trauma with a man they experienced earlier
    in life. Also, I won’t change my approach simply because it has helped
    thousands and thousands of people to heal themselves.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>&#8212;&nbsp;Dr. Schulze</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>PS: When I use the word pussy, meaning
    someone is “being a pussy”, I am referring to them being a wimp, like <span
class=GramE>pussy-footing</span> around, like tip-toeing, whether they’re male
    or female. I am not referring to the female genitalia, the vagina or vulva, a
    cat, the James Bond film <i>Octopussy</i>,
    nor referring to women being afraid, cowardly or degrading women or anything
    else in your wounded imagination. </span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span
style='font-size:135%;'>And
    Another From a Pastor…</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Dr. Schulze,</span></i><i></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>I enjoy seeing someone with some conviction and zeal in a generation
    that has become mainly pleasers. </span></i><i></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>I am a pastor in NY and the same thing happens with spiritual
    teachings. People proclaim that they love God and believe in Him and then a
    little snake comes along and then people begin to question His integrity in a
    blink of an eye.</span></i><i></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>In my 11 years as pastor I have seen scores of healings take place
    in front of me, yet we could have seen more if their faith wasn't so
    wishy-washy. </span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Thank you much for your honest messages and great products.</span></i><i></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>&#8212;&nbsp;John F.</span></i><b><i></i></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span

    Years Young!</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span></i><i></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Good for you!!! The first reason I started buying your wonderful
    products is because I DID NOT WANT FILLERS. If I use Flaxseed I want it freshly
    ground, not put up and mixed with the other things. I would much rather have
    the pure&nbsp;ingredients that you use then have them watered down with bulk
    fillers.&nbsp;I used your SuperFood Plus for only&nbsp;three days and I could

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Dear Friends,</p>
  <p>Last week's BLOG was my response to <a href="https://herbdocblog.com/article/Answer/response-to-a-veryangry-medical-doctor/">A Very Angry Medical
    Doctor</a>.</p>
  <p><b>I want you to be very
    clear about one thing.</b></p>
  <p><b>My only focus of my
    BLOG is to teach you Natural Healing and Herbal Medicine, and my desired
    outcome is for you to be able to Heal Yourself Naturally and to Create Powerful
    Health! </b></p>
  <p>I want you to have a very healthy life, and to live that
    life as long as you possibly can. I’ve said it before, QUALITY and QUANTITY,
    that is what I want for me,<i> and for YOU!</i></p>
  <p>So to be very clear, when I answer a BLOG like I did last week,
    my sole purpose is NOT to defend myself, nor is it to attack the medical
    profession. I don’t give a damn about this doctor, or what he thinks about me,
    or my healing methods. I have been attacked all of my adult life for my
    beliefs, my clinical experience and what I do, so much, I don’t even notice it
    anymore. </p>
  <p>My sole purpose for answering this BLOG is that I know how
    important this is for your Natural Healing Education, for me to respond to
    medical doctors like this. I know it is just a matter of time before you run
    into one, <i>if you haven’t already</i>, and
    I want you to be prepared and to be able to defend yourself, <i>or at least be strong enough to walk away</i>.
    I want you to live your life your way, and take charge of your health, and the
    health of your family, the way you choose.</p>
  <p>Sure, Healing Yourself Naturally and Creating Powerful
    Health is a lot about Routines, Programs, and how to use Natural and Herbal
    Medicine. But don’t underestimate the importance of understanding the
    Philosophy of Natural Healing and the Foundational Principles of Natural
    Healing. <b>Without this Philosophy and
    Principles, you would crumble at your first confrontation with an egotistical,
    myopic medical doctor with a strong personality and a medical bag filled with
    10 dollar Latin and Greek words.</b> Worse, if you crumble, the next moment you
    will find yourself waking up, doped up, lying in a hospital bed, missing a few
    parts, and slapped with a huge financial burden (if not bankruptcy) for all of
    this medical torture.</p>
  <p>So from time to time, between which herb to use for what
    ailment, I MUST teach you about the other important aspects of Natural Healing
    and one of them is <b>standing your ground
    and keeping your belief and integrity intact when face-to-face with a powerful
    medical doctor</b>. One who has probably had more education than some of you,
    (although not in grammar and spelling) and who probably makes more money than
    you, and probably is considered a more important or valued member of society
    than you. I want you to not only survive this confrontation, I want you to keep
    your cool and make great decisions. After all, the doctor may have more formal
    education, money and prestige, but you have much more common sense, and <i>your </i>bag is filled with Natural Healing
    Education, Philosophy, a few bottles of herbs and a lot more Love in your Heart!</p>
  <p>So, this week's BLOG was going to be my answer to two people
    who wrote me about severe Menstrual problems and Endometriosis (don’t worry
    ladies, I’ll post it next week) but your responses to my Angry Doctor BLOG were
    more than any BLOG I have written to date. Not one negative response (I have
    not heard back from Merlin, so hopefully he took my advice and stopped reading
    my BLOG) but literally hundreds of positive and very supportive responses, so I
    thank all of you who took the time to write me. </p>
  <p>Some of you even thought I made the BLOG up. I know, it’s
    almost hard to believe, and written so badly. I assure you, I have better
    things to do than to make up blogs, and I don’t lie. So Merlin’s letter to me
    was printed, EXACTLY as it was sent to me.</p>
  <p>I want to honor some of you who took the time to tell me
    your story or just say hello. I also thought that the rest of you might enjoy
    hearing from some like-minded people. Sometimes knowing that you are not the
    only “health nut” in your neighborhood, can give you more fuel and strength to
    carry on.</p>
  <p><b>I also understand why
    some of you were so infuriated by this medical doctor's ignorant statements, as
    you felt like he was trying to invalidate your healing miracles, that you worked
    so hard to create.</b> </p>
  <p>So this week I am posting some of the people who wrote me
    last week. I apologize that I am not printing all of them but there are just
    too many. I thank each and EVERY one of you for your responses. I love you too.</p>
  <p>You are not alone!</p>
  <p>&mdash;Dr. Schulze</p>
<hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
 <i><p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
<span style='color:red'>Hello, I actually do not have a question, but I wanted to comment on
    an email I just received about the angry doctor. I just want you to know that
    my mother in law, about 11 years ago was diagnosed with high stages of breast
    and colon cancer. She refused the chemo and radiation. Her doctors said she
    would be dead if she didn't. Instead she used your Incurables program and is a
    cancer survivor, alive and well today. She just welcomed her 14th grandchild at
    the age of 53. That doctor has no idea what he is talking about. If it weren't
    for your program, I wouldn't have ever known my mother in law. So for that, I
    thank you. It's because of your program and God that she is here today. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Thank you for your time.</span><br /><br />
  <span style='
color:red'>&mdash;Kristen S. in Mason, OH</span></p>
<hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>You are amazing!!! Stand up to this angry medical doctor!! Great
    response!! My dad is 90 with Alzheimer's and we take your stuff and the MD told
    me four years ago that he would have to be put in a nursing home.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I immediately started herbs and he is off all meds and juicing and
    looking amazing and walking two miles a day! BULLSHIT to take my hope away!!! I
    love herbs!! Way to go!!!!!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>&mdash;Elizabeth B.</span></p>
  <hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>Would you promise me never to go out of business? That is my <span
class=GramE>question</span>. The blog &quot;Response To A Very Angry Medical
    Doctor&quot; was very candid of you and very, very informative. I enjoyed
    reading it... why? Because laughter creates endorphins, which is good for one's
    health! I completely agree that all doctors should be taking natural health education
    courses as part of their training every few years to keep up with the latest,
    especially those who have practiced for many years. <b>Case in point, when my wife suffered from urinary tract infections, the
    pain was so bad, she had to go to ER and they gave her antibiotics that caused
    her to get sick due to be sensitive to penicillin and other drugs. This
    happened twice. When she took your KB formula when having the symptoms again of
    a urinary tract infection, it was gone within 24 hours! This she used on two
    different occasions and has never had an episode since! Woo Hoo! </b></span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Thanks again for creating such wonderful products.</span><br /><br />
  <span style='color:red'>&mdash;Brian A. in Reseda, CA</span></p>
  <hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>Thank you so much for your blog, I really enjoy it, and that on a
    regular basis. It's not only educational on a very elevated basis, and correct
    in what you say, but it also makes me smile.&nbsp; I love the way you responded to the
    angry medical doctor, priceless! Keep it up, Dr. Schulze, the world is a better
    place for you being there for us!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>&mdash;Angie S. in Arklow, Ireland</span></p>
  <hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>I don't have a question I just wanted to write to say THANK YOU for
    all that you do! I recently read the article on your site where a medical
    doctor attacked you for &quot;being you.&quot; If it were not for you and especially
    your Intestinal Formula #1 I would have been very sick and full of disease by
    now as I suffered from severe constipation for years. You have helped me and
    countless others renew our health, THANK YOU!!! Your passion to help relieve so
    many of us our agonies and tribulations is a testimony of how much you care and
    how big your heart is. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Keep fighting the good fight Dr. Schulze!!!</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>&mdash;James G. in Corpus Christi, TX</span></p>
  <hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Awesome response to the angry medical doctor. When I went on your
    'There are no Incurable DISEASES' I was on Oxygen 24/7 and couldn't walk to the
    bathroom without my Oxygen. I was out of wind, couldn't breath, but after doing
    your program I was loading lumber, walking around doing all sorts of things
    that I haven't been able to do for about three years.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Thank you Dr. Schulze. </span><br /><br />

  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze, </span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>Thank you so very much for continuing to be a voice that inspires,
    impresses, afflicts the comfortable, and comforts the afflicted. You call
    me to be a better person and a better healing professional. God Bless You
    and Your Work.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>&mdash;Tina L.</span></p>
  <hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>I LOVED your answer to that DUMB medical doctor!</span>
  <span style='color:red'>Herbs over medicine has always been a better solution!</span>
  <span style='color:red'>You and you alone have been my Guru since the nineties, and I don't
    want any medical doctor messing with my body. </span><br /><br />
  <span style='color:red'>Thank you for your herbs that really work!</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:red'>&mdash;Raya H. in Venice, FL</span></p>
  <hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>Why does that doctor say you are ruining his business?? Is he saying
    he's losing patients to you and that many patients leaving him to you is
    ruining his business? Hum, if that's what he's saying, oh well. Oh, and who's
    angry? I really did laugh. That doctor is livid and rude and says you need
    anger management classes. His anger worries me how he is toward his patients. I
    have known doctors like that and whew! I ran away from them. I personally know people cured of cancer
    and other illnesses by herbs, etc. Thank you for your products, I love the
    videos and blogs and just everything about you and your products. Oh, thank you
    again for publishing the latest blog. It made my day and honestly I did laugh out loud. That was the best
    medicine I could have ever taken today.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Best to you,</span><br /><br />
  <span style='color:red'>&mdash;Carol B. in Trinidad, CO</span></p>
  <hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>OMG!&nbsp; I loved, loved,
    loved your answer to that so called medical doctor!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Right on!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I have been using your herbs and SuperFood for almost 10 years. I will continue to use them for the rest
    of my life, however long that may be. I hope you continue offering these things for a very long time!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>God bless!</span><br /><br />

  <hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>After reading so much negativity from the 'medical professionals'
    out there, I wanted you to have some positive feedback from the 'other side'.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I have been working with natural and herbal medicine before entering
    PA school, so I was not easily brainwashed. I now see both sides of the
    'debate' pretty clearly and totally side with your version.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I now let patients know the choice they have in many instances, and
    use your Anti-I with great results instead of staples and stitches. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I love the line we are drilled with: &quot;There is no cure for the
    common cold&quot;, since it has been years that I have kept clear from colds
    and flu while exposed to diseases in hospitals and clinics. My attending
    doctors in pediatrics say that they get sick with something dreadful at least
    once a year, and I have gone through many years without incident. Your
    Supertonic is magical- or natural...</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I wish you continued success in helping show people how to improve
    their health and survive the 'system' we are in, and don't let some 'higher
    than thou' people bother you.</span></p>

  <span style='color:red'>YOUR LETTER FROM MERLIN TELLS ME HE CAN'T SPELL WORTH SH--!</span></p>

  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>I cannot adequately describe to you how much I enjoy reading what
    you have to say. You almost always make me laugh and I almost always learn
    something new from you. I am so grateful that you have a passion to share what
    you have learned with the rest of us, and in that way you improve the energy
    and life on this planet. This latest blog was funny too, but also sad for that
    poor doctor, who is obviously frustrated about the holistic view of health,
    which is way more than the western view of &quot;medicine&quot;, which reduces
    human beings to a compendium of symptoms. I admire your patience, tolerance,
    wisdom and tenacity. I just want you to know that I think you are doing an
    incredible job, and that you are truly an asset to life in this world. Thanks
    for who you are. And thanks for making me laugh!</span></p>

  <span style='color:red'>Go Dr Schulze, Loved
    your response to Merlin, the Dr. in Stockton Ca. I respect you and love to read
    your blogs. I have done your detox programs and swear by them. I am grateful
    for real Doctors like you who actually care about people.</span></p>

  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>THANKS! Love you Dr Schulze! Your herbs are incredible
    and I feel fantastic... I also share your info with friends and we love it! Love that letter, was that really serious? Well anyway, at least
    you have a great sense of humor. Thanks again and much appreciation for all
    your hard work and incredible herbal products.</span></p>

  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dr. Schulze, </span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>I really appreciate all you do! These arrogant doctors are precisely
    why I started looking for alternatives to healing. I had been to around 10
    doctors in a span of 7 years, who were surprisingly unempathetic when they
    couldn't diagnose me. One even said I needed a psychiatrist! Finally, my
    GYN figured out I had narcolepsy and a dead colon. So he referred me to a
    doctor who prescribed Provigil, and Xrem. I read the warnings and I was scared
    to take it and for good reason. DEATH is a side effect! The absolute beauty of
    your products is that it works for everyone! A few diet changes and using your
    other products as needed created a new me that could walk, talk, drive a car
    and enjoy life again without frequent &quot;shut downs&quot;. I hardly
    notice many of my symptoms anymore and only hope to continue to improve. I am
    so very grateful and I cannot thank you enough!</span></p>

  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>The blog reply to the angry doctor was amazing. I laughed more than
    I have laughed in a while. I am a registered nurse, and I have been relying on
    natural/herbal &quot;medicines&quot; all of my life!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I am a big fan of all of your products. My first experience was
    &quot;flu shot&quot;; then I found SuperFood, and the cleanses, and Air Detox,
    and so on. I just sipped my first batch of potassium broth, practicing up for
    the Liver Flush.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I am now a hospice nurse, because I do not have to push medications
    and interventions. At the meeting last week, I told the team that what matters
    is &quot;Golden Rule Medicine&quot;: Do unto patients as you would have a care
    provider do unto you.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dr. Schulze is my idea of a &quot;Golden Rule&quot; doctor! Best

  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Great comments to the angry doc. I believe he has good reason to
    worry about the medical profession. People are waking up and taking charge of
    their own healing and I wonder how all the people could ever have given over
    our power to an unnatural and chemical substance. Its day is almost over. Thank
    you for giving us the facts. </span></p>

  <span style='color:red'>I love it! This is an awesome blog, as I almost lost my life to
    doctors and started studying herbal medicine which saved my life. Maybe if you
    get other nasty emails like that one, you can ask them, if Dr. Schulze medicine
    is bogus, then why do doctors always warn you that you can't take the drugs
    with Dr. Schulze's medicine because it's strong? Now I think they even mention
    that on doctor's papers: Do not to take the &quot;chemical drugs that they
    prescribe&quot; If you are using any of Dr Schulze's formulas. How funny is
    that????</span></p>

  <span style='color:red'>In response to your angry doctor, I applaud you. I am one of those so called people that
    they didn't give hope to. I had a
    brain bleed and my left side was completely paralyzed. I lay in the hospital and they gave me
    drugs that caused a cancer that I didn't have before the bleed. Even when my left side was completely
    gone, being on so many drugs, to the point of being a vegetable, I still
    couldn't understand why I had this cancer. I asked questions and all the things
    they said that caused it, I didn't do. So, still being afraid, I put two and two together. They were giving me a drug to stop
    seizures that I didn't have when I had my stroke and the drug was so toxic that
    they had to take blood tests everyday. My liver started to go bad. With the
    other 9 drugs, this particular drug was making me sick. My family was too
    scared to take me out of the hospital, so during the night when they weren't
    looking, I taught myself to walk. They caught me standing one day and told me they would put a straight
    jacket on me if they caught me standing again. Yes, put a straight jacket on a
    paralyzed person. You see, I had
    really good insurance and they were going to keep me for as long as they could. I told my friend about what was
    happening and she said she would lie for me and tell them I would stay with
    her. It didn't work. So they gave me more drugs to shut me
    up. (Bad girl!!) They came into my
    room and told me they were moving me to a nursing home (insurance again). I got up and started to walk out of the
    room. My sister almost fell out of
    her chair. She said, &quot;You
    don't walk” I replied, &quot;They won't let me!&quot; She got me out in two days. I got a new doctor that weaned me off
    the drugs, I detoxed, got retested and the cancer was gone. Yes, I lied for my life, but over 12
    years later I am alive, walking and even got a college degree with brain
    damage. I wrote a book about the
    rest of the horror that happened to me, I wanted people to know what really
    goes on. I fought for my life against more that 15 doctors. Yes, I am one of those patients.... that
    lived. I love you Dr. Schulze, keep
    up the good work. My dream is to meet you someday. I want to hug you. Maybe someday when I go to pick up my
    herbs, I will run into you. </span></p>

  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style=''>(edited
    because of length)</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Just a note to say, I LOVE YOU, Dr. Schulze! =) </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I just read your reply to the medical doctor, &amp; it was perfect!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I've followed your approach since I was a teenager when you only had
    10 steps for a healthy life instead of 20 on the back of your pamphlet! =) I
    used to hand those out to everybody back in the day, including all of the
    people around me who were heavily in the western medical fields</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>My own goal has always been to empower others, instead of enable
    them, since people usually give their own power away to medical doctors, or
    other groups they turn to under false hopes to actually help them. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I want you to know that there ARE medical doctors out there who also
    talk to their patients about your herbal remedies and alternative therapies,
    regardless of the risk. Many MD's have truly lost faith in their own
    professions simply seeing the pharmaceutical companies prosper, while their
    patients still stay sick or addicted to medical drugs. I've experienced this
    first-hand.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Thank you for what you do, from the bottom of my heart! You have
    truly been a monumental blessing to others with your aggressive, in your face
    approach that I know has always come from a place of love. You give tough love
    in the finest sense of the word! In fact, you remind me a lot of myself! LOL! </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Warmest wishes and many wonderful blessings to you!</span></p>

  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>This is not a question. I totally believe in you and recommend you to people all of the
    time. You cured yourself of major
    heart disease and more, and studied with Dr. Christopher for whom I have the
    utmost respect. I am just writing because
    that last letter from an angry medical doctor...was that for real? I wonder. He misspelled common words and while he
    used all the key phrases, I wonder if he really was a doctor at all. I think he was a flake.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>But whatever, you gave a good answer even if he was a flake/fake.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Just wanting to tell you that I am a fan, and when and if I ever get
    seriously ill, it is to you and your methods I will turn. In the meantime I will just continue
    with my high raw diet and juicing and good health.... I was going to say knock
    on wood, but if a person lives right, they don't need to knock on wood.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I would love for you to have a conversation with my sister, who got
    a PhD in bio-organic chemistry and did a post doc with a Nobel scientist in
    France, and who then went to law school and became a patent attorney... and who
    now works for Glaxco-Smith-Klein (I know!) As she will argue with me that pharmaceutical medicines and herbal
    medicines aren't all that different, that they come from the same source and
    work the same (and as you can imagine from her high degrees, my sister is a
    very intelligent person) but I wish she understood that herbs, while they might
    have interactions and some undesirable side effects, wreak nothing of the havoc
    on the body that pharmaceutical drugs (poisons) do.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Anyways, this blog was entertaining as always if nothing else.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I think you are the best and I am so grateful you do the work that
    you do with the intelligence and humor that you do.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Keep on keep on!</span></p>

  <span style='color:red'>I read your blog 'Response to an Angry Doctor.' It is difficult for
    me to believe the authenticity of his complaints. Any individual who has
    completed four years of college and an additional four in medical school would
    not substitute 'they're' with 'there.' In addition, 'there' was substituted for 'their.' Either this individual is not an M.D., or an error was made
    in the transcription. </span></p>

  <span style='color:red'>I am in total agreement with you in the reply you gave to the
    &quot;angry medical doctor&quot;. My husband and I were just married a year when he died last year of
    glioblastoma stage 4 at the young age of 45. He had been on medical drugs since
    the age of 17 and they finally killed him. By the time I met him there was
    nothing I could do. I tried getting
    him off the drugs but it was to late. (A long sad story) So called, doctors and the drug
    companies have done a great job in killing billions of people. FYI, I'm angry at them. I won't touch their drugs. I am so thankful to people like you,
    Bernard Jensen, John Christopher and other &quot;health food nuts&quot; I've
    met along the way. Thank you so
    much. Keep up the good work.</span></p>

  <span style='color:red'>What an excellent and sweet response to the angry doctor!</span>
  <span style='color:red'>I am on your side! I have worked in hospitals and nursing homes for
    many years and have grown very tired of the band-aid treatments. The main
    problem as I see it, is that most people do not want to change their sick life
    style, they just want a pill to make it better or worse yet, a shot.</span>
    <span style='color:red'>Keep doing what you are doing! I regret you do not have your clinic
    any longer - to go there and learn hands on. So I keep learning on my own;
    thankfully I have a good foundation from my child hood and herbs just seem the
    right way for me.</span></p>

  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dr. Schulze, </span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>I just wanted to e-mail you to let you know how proud I am of you
    and how much I appreciate you. I read your latest blog entry about &quot;the
    very angry medical doctor.&quot; Let me tell you, this Merlin guy sounded like
    a complete schmuck. First of all, his e-mail was so poorly written that it did
    not look like it came from a professional at all. I counted more than a few
    words that were spelled incorrectly and the guy just sounded like an idiot.
    Second, he is full of crap about western medicine not being toxic and bashing
    herbs/natural medicine claiming they do not cure disease. Let's think about how
    many prescription medications killed and kill tons of people and are recalled.
    Vioxx comes to mind. Third, his claim about prescription drugs coming from
    plants is a total misconstruing of the facts. I will give it to him that
    medication may begin as some plant constituent or extract but the final
    results-the prescription drug itself-is far from it. They are chemically
    altered in labs. I am currently a law school student in Charleston, South
    Carolina. This past summer I took an Intellectual Property law class and one of
    the first things we learned about patents is that you cannot patent a plant.
    Man must chemically alter in some way a plant in order to put a patent on it. Therefore,
    drug manufacturers have to chemically alter/create/produce their drugs in order
    to patent them. And guess what? You would never see Big Pharma promote a plant
    or herb because they cannot patent it and therefore cannot make money off of
    it!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>So, since I have blabbed enough, I will finish with this. This
    Merlin is completely off base. After reading his message to you I wanted to
    both laugh and throw up at the same time. He is just completely off his rocker.
    I am so glad you put him in his place. I love all of you products and to be
    quite honest, I love you. You are a wonderful human being. I feel privileged
    just to have access to all your great healing products. Please keep fighting
    the good fight. Have a wonderful day!</span></p>

    “there, their, and they're”. Scary! Nice of you to let that go! </span></p>

  <hr style="height:1px;width:75%;">
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Dr. Schulze,</span><br /><br />
  
  <span style='color:red'>Are you kidding me? I believe in your products and know they work.
    But that little contrivance in your web blog is so farcical as to be hilarious.
    No medical doctor would ever write such a load of tripe. If such a low
    cognition individual is actually a doctor, then some serious action must be
    taken immediately to strip that buffoon of his license. How in the hell
    did he get a bachelor's degree without learning the proper use of
    their/there/they're, and your/you're? I have known some pretty dippy doctors,
    but if anyone thinks that a doctor would write such a ridiculous response to
    your &quot;threat&quot; then they are a fool. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>Please don't stoop to trying to portray the medical field as being
    so full of malicious frauds. Western medicine has a place just like you
    do. They're great for fixing the symptoms of stupid people who insist on eating
    garbage and sitting around all day, but don't want to feel lousy. It's
    not the doctors' fault that people suck so bad. Still I do agree that they
    should have started checking your stuff out a long time ago. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I wouldn't have wasted your time and space responding to someone
    that is clearly too poorly educated to be a doctor. That crapola read like a
    bored housewife, or some sort of reverse cheerleader who wanted to bait you
    with fresh meat for a response. I just hope it isn't some sort of
    love/hate note you opted to contrive to give yourself the fodder for a speech.
    Though perhaps that is too cynical of me to be true. Regardless, I
    normally don't take my time to offer my opinion, because I know that it will be
    lost in the spam, but I just hoped that you'd take my word for this- you are
    too good for that sort of silliness. Your stuff works. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I know a woman who was on death's doorstep from eating an all
    convenience store diet. Parasites and fungus had completely riddled her system,
    and she was only 24. She still has scars all over her hands from the fungal
    infection that had turned her hands into brittle cracking straw. Someone turned
    her onto your products right then, and since she has become an organics master.
    When I met her her diet was absolutely perfect, with only pure organic
    products. She used to soak her nuts overnight to activate the enzymes
    therein. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>I was sick from shabby living, and she turned me onto healthy eating
    and yoga. She also convinced my wife and I to use your SuperFood.
    We are now members of your SuperFood a month club, and I feed it to my
    daughter twice a day. It has offered the incredible nutrients that keep
    my wife and I very healthy, and when we run out we wait with baited breath
    until the next bottle arrives. We are planning to order an extra bottle
    so we can have a backup when the first runs out because it sucks to run out of
    SuperFood when you know what it is worth. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style='color:red'>My daughter who has had SuperFood almost every day since she was one
    is now almost three, but she is the size of a four or five year old. She
    has high functioning intelligence, and can read small words. She is emotionally
    intelligent and she is vigorously strong. Aside from the SuperFood that
    she has in her twice a day smoothie, she doesn't eat very much else, because
    she is fussy and difficult to feed. The other things she eats are not the
    best choices, including, but not limited to breaded chicken, cheese,
    lunchmeats, and eggs. She also eats almonds and raisins, and a few other
    healthy things too, but honestly, the bulk of her nutrition is SuperFood and
    smoothies, that we make with bananas, avocado, orange juice, and whatever
    berries we have on hand. Her stupendous might can only be attributed to the
    SuperFood. So if you want something to post on your blog, put that in
    your pipe and bite down. SuperFood is awesome and so are you. Good luck and God
    bless you Dr. Schulze. If everyone used your products we'd have a great
    time putting big pharma out on their butts. Keep charging!!</span></p>

  <span style='color:red'>Good going. About Dr. Merlin, my mother always told me 'don't

    necessary. Any person with a thinking brain (unfortunately some are fixed on
    the medical doctor being God don't hear) the dangers of most drugs. All
    you have to do is listen to the commercial on TV. Take any drug they are
    pushing and hear the side effects (nausea, vomiting, stomach aches, sudden loss
    of vision, blurred vision, hypertension, stroke, and if you are taking
    anti-depressants the side effects are worsening of depression, suicidal
    thought, suicide, etc. Thanks, but no thanks. Keep up the good work. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[  <p><span style=''>Friends, </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Most women think monthly
    Menstrual Cramping is normal; IT IS NOT. </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Sure, ALL women experience
    some mild, occasional menstrual cramping from time to time. But, when the pain
    is more than an occasional twinge, and it comes EVERY month, and especially if
    it is moderate to extreme pain, and includes irregular or heavy bleeding, well,
    this is a sign that you need to get in balance, and steps should be taken to create
    better health.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>In my clinic, I dealt with
    thousands of models and actresses that had mild to extreme menstrual cramps,
    and EVERY single one of them were able to make lifestyle changes and use herbal
    medicines that made even the most extreme and totally debilitating cramping go
    away.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>The following are two letters
    from BLOG readers about Menstrual Cramps. <b>If
    you are experiencing monthly menstrual pain, or abnormal bleeding, PLEASE read
    on, as I have some answers for you that will change your life.</b></span></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>I am writing on behalf of my wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;We just started our
    journey to creating powerful health and are currently working through bowel and
    liver detoxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife has what the <span class=GramE>doctors</span> think is endometriosis, but are not certain.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the
    uterine lining grows in places it shouldn't according to my Internet
    diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem comes during her monthly
    cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;While that time of the month comes with cramps and discomfort
    and pain is a given most of the time, however, when she tries to have a bowel
    movement during this time she is reduced to sobbing from the
    pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the contracting of <span class=GramE>those muscles is</span> excruciating.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is even with very loose stools, not just like
    forcing backed up constipated junk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this only happens during
    her period, no other time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't bear to see her in this much pain
    and I know there has got to be something she can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors
    just keep saying, &quot;i think, i think&quot; and pass it off (shocking I
    know) and I figured you'd be the best to help solve this painful mystery.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Thanks so much for you time and efforts.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>P.S. On a side note, even though you can come off as a jerk and
    crass to some, I for one appreciate blunt honesty.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a big
    fan of strong language but you know better than anyone that walking around
    kissing babies and hugging kittens ain't gonna cut it when a life is on the
    line.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see your brutal honesty as the passion it is and thank God
    for your ministry of Creating Powerful Health (and giving swift kicks to those
    who need it).</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='color:red'>Keep soldiering on good sir!</span></i><i></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>&#8212;&nbsp;Zak R. in New Albany,&nbsp;IN</span></i></p>
  <p><span style=''>Dear Zak,</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>It is almost always <i>women</i> writing me about helping their <i>husband</i> so congratulations for writing
    your letter on behalf of your wife. Good man and Great Husband! </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>And thanks for your kind
    words regarding my blunt honesty and passion. The bottom line is that <b>it all comes from the clinic</b>, and this
    is what sets me apart from most “armchair” herbalists and “wimpy” natural
    healers. In the clinic, after a few years, if not a few decades, you simply
    learn what works, <i>and what doesn’t</i>. <b>It is ALL about helping people heal their
    diseases.</b> So my passion and bluntness are something that came out of my
    clinic, simply because they were effective tools at nudging people to heal
    themselves naturally.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Medical doctors are generally much more soft
    spoken and polite, they can be, because then later they sedate you, and when
    you are sleeping, well, that is when they beat you up, cutting, burning, drilling
    and carving your ass off, like a butcher. Since I don’t have that option, I
    need to do a little more ass kicking face to face, while my patients are awake.
    I am glad you understand.</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>And great that you are
    working your way through my 5-Day Detox Programs, this will help both you and
    your wife to Create Powerful Health and her problem may in fact have been
    solved already by now, <i>before</i> you
    read this answer, but in case it isn’t and for all of the others, let’s go!</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Specifically, for your wife,
    she may or may not have endometriosis, but either way our plan will be the
    same.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial;
'>For Menstrual Problems and Even Endometriosis</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>First, she must start on my <b>Female Formula</b> IMMEDIATELY and get her
    hormones balanced. This is the real permanent cure. She should start with
    taking 2 droppersful three times daily, indefinitely. I would suggest, from
    what you tell me about her condition, that she should continue taking this
    formula for at least a year. This alone will balance her female hormones and 90%
    of the time this will be all that is needed for her complete healing of her
    menstrual problem and her endometriosis.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>During menstruation,
    especially during her next menstruation, if it comes in a week or two, this may
    not be enough time elapsed for this formula to have solved her problem entirely.
    She can add the additional dosage of my <b>Female
    Formula </b>of 2 droppersful one or two more times during the day or night,
    which would increase her dosage to 2 droppersful four or five times a day. She
    can also take a larger dose of 4 droppersful anytime. She just needs to
    discover what works best for her. <b>If she
    is still in pain during her next “period”, I suggest the following additions…</b></span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Female “SHOT”</span></b><br /><span style=''>This is what I designed this
    “SHOT” for. It is an emergency dose of my <b>Female
    Formula</b> along with additional herbs that will solve any hormonal imbalance.
    If she feels any pain coming on with her next menstruation, take a whole <span
class=GramE><b>Female</b></span><b> “SHOT”</b> IMMEDIATELY.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Nerve Tonic</span></b><br /><span style=''>This formula is mainly an
    antispasmodic formula, a pain-relieving formula and a sedative. For all three
    of these reasons, she should take this formula when experiencing any menstrual
    cramping. The <b><i>antispasmodic action</i></b> will relax her uterus and keep it from
    cramping, the <b><i>pain-relieving action </i></b>will do just that, and the <b><i>sedative
    action</i></b> will help her to relax as well.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>I would suggest 2 to 4
    droppersful as needed, but up to 8 or 10 <span class=SpellE>droppersful</span> <span
class=GramE>can</span> be used. This formula is strong tasting, so add her dose
    to an ounce of juice. </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>NOTE: With very sensitive
    people, overdosing on this formula can cause mild vomiting, but this is in no
    way dangerous. But, I always mention this as most people prefer to start with a
    lower dosage of 2 to 4 droppersful and then work their way up to the higher
    doses of 8 to 10 droppersful.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Hot Water Bottle</span></b><br /><span style=''>This is grandma’s remedy, and
    a very powerful and effective one, but we have almost forgotten it. Fill a hot
    water bottle with BOILING water, and place a towel over her lower abdomen, then
    the bottle, and cover it with another towel. Place the bottle on top of and
    just above her pubic bone. ‘Ahhhhhhh’, that’s the sound you will hear, as the
    heat relieves the menstrual and uterine cramping, spasm and the pain.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>5-Day BOWEL Detox</span></b><br /><span style=''>I am glad that you told me
    that you were both doing this detox. More often than not, Menstrual Cramping (and
    all types of uterine problems including endometriosis) <span class=GramE>are</span> at least partially caused by constipation or some type of colon problem.
    Intellectually, this may sound odd, but physiologically and anatomically, it
    makes all the sense in the world. </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>In our mind’s eye, the uterus
    is nowhere near the bowel, but <span class=GramE>anatomically,</span> the
    uterus is entirely wrapped by the bowel, with only a very thin layer of skin separating
    the rectum from the vagina. These two organs actually touch each other, so any <span
class=GramE><i>swelling,</i></span><i> spasm, inflammation or irritation</i> on
    the bowel will cause <i>compression,
    squeezing or irritation </i>of the uterus. This is pure Newtonian physics, of <i>“every action having an equal and opposite
    reaction”. </i>Consequently, when the uterus goes to shed its endometrial
    lining during menstruation, and it is <i>compressed</i> or <i>squeezed</i> from bowel constipation, you
    will experience pain. </span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>The bottom line, pun intended, is that ANY
    woman with ANY female complaint or ANY female reproductive disease should FIRST
    do a thorough bowel cleansing.</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;'> In my clinic, with thousands of women, more often than not, a good
    steady dose of my <b>Female Formula</b> and
    a few <b>5-Day BOWEL Detoxes</b> solved
    every type of female problem imaginable.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>Finally, MEAT!</span></b><br /><span style=''>In closing, I would be remiss
    if I didn’t mention the direct relationship between meat and all animal food
    consumption and all male and female reproductive diseases and even menstrual
    problems. Since the production and farming of all meat, from beef to fish and
    everything in-between, and all animal by-products like eggs and milk (liquid
    meat) and dairy products involves the HUGE use of HORMONES, GROWTH HORMONES and
    STEROIDS, I would not be doing you a good service if I did not mention that the
    consumption of animal flesh and animal by-products has been directly linked to
    Endometriosis, Female Hormone Imbalance, Uterine, Ovarian and Breast Cancer and
    almost ALL Female Reproductive Diseases, Disorders and even Cancer. Not to
    mention a foundational cause of Benign Prostate Hypertrophy (Hyperplasia) and
    Prostate Cancer, and all cancers for that matter.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Even if you buy your meat
    HORMONE-FREE, an animal’s natural hormones are EXTREMELY ALIEN to your body and
    throw your body a curveball that really causes it to react in a 1,000 different
    alien ways, just one of them being reproductive imbalance and disease, <b>and abnormal growths in female and male
    reproductive organs</b>. Just imagine putting cow hormones that have the
    genetic messages for your body to grow from zero to 2,000 pounds in the first
    year of your life, into your body. This is a POWERFUL GROWTH HORMONE, and it
    will cause your body to grow abnormally.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>There is NO animal on this
    planet that drinks the milk of another species, and we are really giving
    ourselves the wrong genetic messages by doing this. I didn’t say that ice cream
    doesn’t taste good; I am just saying that it is the perfect genetic roadmap for
    making a cow. And looking at half the people I see walking around, well, it
    looks like they are turning into cows.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Zak, you are a good man and a
    great husband, so keep up the good work and add my suggestions to your wife’s
    health program and she will be over her menstrual problems in a few months, if
    not immediately.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>&#8212;&nbsp;Dr. Schulze</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial;
'>Horrible Menstrual Cramps #2</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>Dear Dr. Schulze,</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>First off, I would like to say thank you so much for offering your
    products and knowledge to the world despite all of the scrutiny from the
    medical industries.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>I turned to your products after being diagnosed with an under-active
    thyroid. Long story short, after being overdosed on medications from a doctor
    and being sent into a thyroid storm I decided to follow your cleanses for three
    months. I got re-tested and my thyroid had been healed! That made me a true
    believer. Now I take your Superfood Plus religiously (along with some of your
    other products). My husband, mom, and uncle all do as well.&nbsp; :)</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>And now for my question... I have one issue I just can't seem to
    overcome.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>When I was 15 I started getting horrible menstrual cramps.&nbsp; Not
    your ordinary, a little bit uncomfortable, I feel like whining cramps.&nbsp;
    These were excruciating.&nbsp; They sent me to the ER twice in a year.&nbsp; I
    fainted, couldn't get up and had to be carried to the car and then to the
    emergency room.&nbsp; That was when it all started.&nbsp; They thought it was
    my appendix at first. Then, I was put on birth control once they realized it
    was related to my cycle. Fast-forward eight years and I was still on the
    pill.&nbsp; <span class=GramE>I was told by another doctor</span> that birth
    control was not good to be on that long and that it could have caused my
    thyroid issues so I immediately got off of it.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>After stopping the pill, it took 18 months for my cycle to come
    back. Now that it has I am back to square one.&nbsp; The pain I experience each
    month on the first night of my cycle is so excruciating that it wakes me from a
    dead sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; It feels like someone is stabbing me over and over
    again with a huge knife.&nbsp; I can't move, keel over on the floor, and am on
    the verge of fainting (or do faint) every time from the pain. It does
    eventually go away... in about 2-3 hours! So, now I know the drill. But 2-3
    hours of agony<span class=GramE>?!</span> What could possibly be causing this?</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>This pain is so bad I can't imagine dealing with this once a month
    for the remainder of my life.&nbsp; I have had about six cycles since they
    started coming back and I literally scream and cry in agony each time.&nbsp;
    Obviously, I don't want to get back on the pill (learned that lesson and spent
    too much time cleansing it out of my body).&nbsp; And I don't want to take pain
    meds each time (I never take anything that isn't natural anyway) nor do pain
    meds even help.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>It seems being on birth control for those eight years helped my
    cramps not exist, but now that I am off of it and don't want to take it, I just
    don't know what to do or where to start with finding a solution.</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>My questions to you are: A. Do you have any idea why I am
    experiencing this? B. Do you have any suggestions for me? <span class=GramE>and</span> C. Have you ever come across this before?</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>I will be forever grateful if you have any ideas for me or can point
    me in the right direction.&nbsp; (Not to mention so will my husband.)&nbsp;</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='color:red'>Thank you soooooo much in advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><i><span
style='color:red'>&#8212;&nbsp;Amber C. in Las Vegas, NV</span></i></p>
  <p><span style=''>Dear Amber,</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>No worries, we can fix you up&#8212;no
    problem, too. And, I definitely want to keep you from becoming a statistic of
    the over 500,000 woman in America every year that get sterilized by medical
    doctors and are gutted of their female organs having a hysterectomy because
    medical doctors won’t use a little common sense and a few dollars worth of
    herbs.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>First, <b>just follow the exact same program I laid out above, for Zak’s wife,</b> making sure you include using my <b>Intestinal
    Formula #1</b>, but hopefully doing my complete <b>5-Day BOWEL Detox</b> at least once, if not a few times. And stay on my <b>Female Formula</b> for at least three
    months, if not a year, or until <span class=GramE>your</span> menstrual
    cramping problem is over.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>OK, let’s get specific and I
    will answer a few of your questions…</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial;
'>The Birth Control Pill</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>Using the birth control pill
    all of these years basically just suppressed your body from being a woman, and
    suppressed your menstrual cycles. <b>And as
    you can now see, although suppression often seems to solve the problem, it
    actually just covers it up and hides it, and then when the suppressive therapy
    is halted, the dis-ease comes back, and more often than not, it comes back with
    a vengeance.</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Suppressing your ovaries,
    which are just one part of your endocrine system, could also definitely throw
    off your entire endocrine system and endocrine balance <i>because, </i>your endocrine organs are your ovaries, but also your Thyroid
    and many other organs like your Hypothalamus, Pituitary and Pineal glands in
    your brain, as well as your Pancreas, Adrenal glands and any organ in your body
    that manufactures and then secretes hormones directly into your bloodstream. So,
    it is very possible that the pill also affected your thyroid too, but for you,
    the <b>Female Formula</b> will get your
    entire endocrine system back in balance and should fix your thyroid problem,
    too.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>You see, unlike drugs, herbs work
    with your body to bring it back into balance. Just one of the herbs in the <b>Female Formula</b>, Dong Quai, actually
    sensitizes your Hypothalamus in your brain to pick up and detect subtle changes
    in your hormones (like your estrogen and progesterone). It will tell your body
    to manufacture more when a slight blood level reduction is noticed, but also
    tell your ovaries to STOP producing it much sooner, when the required level is
    detected in your bloodstream. It is basically a tune-up for your hypothalamus
    or a tune-up for your hormone production, regulation and balance.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>So getting off the birth
    control pill was a great idea and you will be healthier because of this, and
    your endocrine system will be in much better balance. The downside of stopping
    the pill, as you discovered, is that it turned your reproductive system back
    on, and now you are back to square one, and back to the menstrual cramps that
    you experienced years ago. But NO PROBLEM, you can heal this easy.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>I actually belly laughed when
    you asked at the end of your letter if I’d ever come across a situation like
    yours before. Hmmm, let’s see? YES!!! Probably 5,000 times! Although I am sure
    you are a very special person, your problem is not unique AT ALL, and is
    actually very common. More women today have menstrual problems than ever before
    in history, more women are put on birth control pills to suppress these
    menstrual problems, more women are sterilized than ever before in history
    because of their menstrual problems and female reproductive cancers are on the
    rise. So, I am glad you wrote this letter long before you were at wit’s end and
    thought about a surgical option.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Finally, please read the
    above answer that I wrote to Zak, and the end of it when I talk about meat
    consumption having a negative impact on female hormone balance, and female
    reproductive organs. It would be great for you to stop eating any and all
    animal foods, at least until you have healed yourself. </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>You will be Healthy and
    Healed soon,</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>&#8212;&nbsp;Dr. Schulze</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

  <p><b><span
style='color:red'>Well, that is a YES, . . . <i>for some, </i>and a big NO for most of
    us.<i></i></span></b><br>
    <span>Is the
    world coming to an end? DEFINITELY! Yeah, yeah, yeah, we all learned that piece
    of <i>positive</i> galactic <span>intel</span> in science class as kids. I remember sitting in 7th-grade
    with a constant erection, hormones bursting, while some dried up old nerd kept
    waking me up, telling me that the sun is slowly swelling in size as it cools
    off and that this “red giant” thing will end in a big explosion. That is if we
    don’t get hit, <i>like in the movies,</i> by
    some rock the size of a city bus that could end our planet’s life prematurely
    and take us all out, like it supposedly did the dinosaurs.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>But that is NOT happening today!</span></b></p>
  <p><span>I don’t
    mean to sound sarcastic, but I don’t base my life on the same calendar as the
    Mayans did (whether it's end is 12/12/2012 or 12/21/2012). Also, I have now lived through about a hundred “end of the world”
    predictions, from California falling off to the big Millennium end, so I would
    say that I find them quite boring, <b>except
    I actually find them very exciting</b>. I will explain why in a few minutes.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='color:red'>OK, so YES, the world will
    end today, for about 7,000 Americans. </span></b><br>
    <span>In about 15
    days by years end, over 2,500,000 (2.5 million) Americans will have died this
    year, and here is how it breaks down.</span></p>
  <p><span>About 1
    MILLION Americans will be dead from the #1 cause of death, Heart and
    Circulatory disease, caused from the food that they ate that blocked, clogged,
    inflamed and damaged their arteries. We know that our food and lifestyle does
    this, and that this is a “<i>disease of the
    fork</i>”, simply because this disease does NOT affect and kill people in other
    countries who eat differently.</span></p>
  <p><span>About
    600,000 will die from malignant neoplasms (cancer). This will happen in spite
    of the federal government’s official “war on cancer” that was started in 1971,
    over 40 years ago. In spite of the trillions and trillions of dollars spent on
    cancer research, and the millions of animals butchered for this research, and
    the trillions and trillions more spent by private medical research facilities, <b>more people are dying from cancer this year
    than EVER before in history. </b>Why? The answer is quite simple. </span></p>
  <p><span>We are
    trying to find a pill to kill cancer, <b>when
    the CURE for CANCER is simply STOPPING what we do that causes our body’s cells
    to mutate and kill us.</b></span></p>
  <p><span>Every smart
    medical doctor and cancer researcher knows exactly what causes cancer&#8212;<b>the typical American lifestyle, and the
    harsh chemicals in it! </b>Their problem is that Americans WILL NOT CHANGE, so
    they are trying to find yet another chemical that will stop our cells from
    mutating, in spite of the toxic chemical barrage in what we eat, drink and
    live. They won’t find it! <b>The only cure
    for cancer, or any disease for that matter, is to STOP doing what causes the
    disease in the first place, and START doing what will Create Powerful Health! </b></span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='color:red'>The rest of the TOP TEN…</span></b><br>
<span>In case you
    are really bored today, the next top causes of American death, <i>in descending order</i>, are Chronic Lower
    Respiratory Diseases, Accidents, Alzheimer’s Disease, Diabetes, Influenza and
    Pneumonia (OVER 50,000 Dead Annually), Nephritis (Kidney Disease), Suicide (Yes,
    at 40,000 a year that means that over 100 people will end their calendar today)
    and Septicemia (40,000 a year will die from infections, mostly contacted in the
    hospital), and followed closely by Liver Disease, Hypertension and then
    Parkinson’s Disease.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='color:red'>OK, why do I find end of
    the world predictions exciting?</span></b><br>
    <b><span
style=''>It is simply that I use all of these
    “End of the World” predictions as wake up calls, to re-examine my life, and see
    where I have ignored it straying off course, where it has wobbled out of
    alignment, and where I need to sharpen my focus and get my life back on track.</span></b></p>
  <p><span>I like to
    imagine that my life will end today, but I get a six-month or one-year extension,
    and now that I have this extra time (<i>but
    I STILL KNOW I will be dead soon</i>) <b>WHAT
    WILL I DO DIFFERENTLY?</b> </span></p>
  <p><b><span
style=''>What would YOU do differently if you
    knew you only had a year to live?</span></b><span style=''> </span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='color:red'>I know what you would do!
    Less STUFF, More FUN!</span></b><br>
    <span>I know
    because in the last decade of my practice, almost ALL of my patients were given
    one to six months to live, so I learned this “end of the world” program really
    well.</span></p>
  <p><span>Most people
    think, “I will work less and spend more time with my family and loved ones”.
    Most people when faced with the end, besides getting well, they think “work
    less, play more”, have more FUN, more TRAVEL and have more SEX! Spend more time
    having fun with family and friends.</span></p>
  <p><span>When I
    would hear this on a daily basis in my clinic, I would think to myself, why
    doesn’t everyone just DO THIS NOW? <b>What
    are we all waiting for?</b></span></p>
  <p><span>Look, I
    know that we all get very busy in life, really busy, working hard, so we can
    buy more stuff, and buy more stuff for our kids, so we can have lives filled
    with more stuff, and then even buy better stuff. And don’t get me wrong, stuff
    is cool, stuff is fun and I LOVE STUFF! But most of us think “get more stuff
    now, and play more with the stuff later”, but then we wait so long, later never
    comes.</span></p>
  <p><span>Many of us
    think that our kids need much more stuff, but in reality, they would rather
    have more quality time with us than more stuff.</span></p>
  <p><span>So we need
    to find that balance, between getting more stuff, and better stuff, <i>and taking the time to enjoy the stuff</i>.
    Having more fun, more love, and spending more quality time with the people that
    we love.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='color:red'>So in Closing</span></b><br>
<span>PLEASE,
    don’t wait for the world to end, or your world to end, or some medical doctor
    to tell you that your world is coming to an end, to work a little less, and
    make yourself a little less busy.</span></p>
  <p><span>Life is a
    “limited time offer”, so take the time RIGHT NOW, to manage your time better,
    to spend more quality time with your family, your loved ones, <b>and spend more time doing the things that
    you love to do.</b></span></p>
  <p><span>Don’t have
    all the regrets on your deathbed that my patients had.</span></p>
  <p><span>It is not
    too late, <b>I don’t think the world will end
    today, but for a moment, let’s pretend it will.</b> And, when you come up with
    any regrets, <b>listen to them,</b> and
    make a plan of how to live your life, paying more attention to what is really
    important to you.</span></p>
  <p><span>It is the
    holiday season my friends, the perfect time for more CELEBRATION&#8212;Celebration
    of Joy, Laughter, Happiness, Love, Bliss&#8212;Celebration of LIFE!</span></p>
  <p><span>Today will
    be gone tomorrow, so let’s live today like YOU might be gone tomorrow. </span></p>
  <p><span>What are
    you waiting for? Let the CELEBRATION begin!</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><span style=''>In EVERY case of mass shootings in the last few decades, the killers were
    later found out to be taking LEGAL, medical doctor prescribed, pharmaceutical,
    mind-altering, prescription drugs. <b>This
    recent horrifying tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut will be no different.</b></span></p>
  <p><b><span style=''>Medical
    doctors won’t stop messing with our kids’ minds, that is the problem here.</span></b><span style=''> <i>It is not really about gun control</i>, <b>the issue here is pharmaceutical drug
    control!</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>You won’t hear this talked about or debated on the pharmaceutically sponsored
    television networks or cable news shows. This is one issue <i>too hot to handle</i> and NONE of them will touch it. <i>That is why I do. I MUST!</i> </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>I am not making a political statement <i>for or against</i> gun control, even though I find it interesting that
    Connecticut has some of the strictest gun control laws in the entire United
    States. I am just pointing out here that as usual, after any horrifying
    senseless killing spree, to ease our pain, it is much easier to strike out and
    blame the weapon of choice, than get to the real cause of the problem. So we
    will continue to blame guns, bullets, knives, hammers, sharpened screwdrivers,
    bricks or whatever other tools these drug induced murderers use, or the people
    who sell the tools or manufacture them, <i>instead
    of looking at the WHY!</i></span></p>
  <p><b><span style=''>WHY did
    these kids kill other kids? That is the real question here, and answering that
    question will give us the real solution.</span></b></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:125%'>Drugs Cause Violence, </span></b><br>
  <span><b><i><span style='font-size:125%'>but</span></i></b></span><b><i><span style='font-size:125%'> NOT the Drugs you Think</span></b><b><span style='font-size:125%'>!</span></i></b><br>
  <span style=''>Take a look back at any of the school, movie theater or <i>wherever </i>shootings in the last few
    decades done by teenagers or young adults&#8212;from Columbine to Virginia Tech
    to the Aurora Movie Theater to Newtown.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>YES, these kids were ALL on drugs, <i>but
    not Crack, PCP, Heroin, Methamphetamines, Ecstasy, LSD or even Pot.</i> So
    while principals, social workers, parents and teachers alike are worrying about
    street drugs and pushers infiltrating our schools and exposing our children, we
    should instead be worrying about what the school nurse is pushing in her white cart
    down the hallway.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p><b><span style=''>EVERY
    single one of these murdering kids in the last few decades was treated by
    medical doctors, with numerous mind-altering or mood-altering drugs, in many <span>instances</span> since childhood, for depression, hyperactivity,
    ADD, ADHD, Bipolar Syndrome or dozens of other new kid’s diseases. </span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>First of all, besides a rare case of depression, none of these diseases
    even existed in our children 30 years ago. The late Dr. Robert Mendelssohn, one
    of the nation’s former leading pediatricians, in his books, ‘How To Raise a Healthy Child In Spite of
    Your Doctor’ and ‘Confessions of a Medical Heretic’ stated that most of
    these new childhood “diseases” are nothing more than typical childhood
    behavior, that we all witnessed when we were kids. But today, because of
    classroom overcrowding, overworked teachers and stressed out parents, drugs are
    an easier choice to numb the minds of unruly kids. Turning these kids into
    well-behaved zombies, well that is “well behaved” <i>until they backfire</i> and become killers<i>.</i></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>In public and private schools today, it is not an unusual sight to see
    the school nurse pushing a drug cart, just like in a hospital, going from
    classroom to classroom, <span>dispensing</span> mind-altering drugs
    to a surprising number of the students.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>But beyond a few bad teachers and some lazy parents, we have to take a
    look at ALL the causes. Besides the huge surge in sugar and artificial
    everything, and serious lack of nutrition and exercise in our kids’ lives, we
    have to look at the pharmaceutical drugs the parents took before and during
    pregnancy.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>We should also look at childhood vaccinations. In 1983, only seven
    vaccinations were suggested for kids. Thirty years later, in 2012, medical
    authorities now suggest <b>SIXTY childhood
    vaccinations. </b>This 2012, 60-vaccination schedule put out by the federal
    government’s Center for Disease Control is approved and endorsed by the
    American Academy of Pediatric Physicians, The American Academy of Family
    Physicians and the Department of Health and Human Services. <i>Our kids don’t have a fighting chance!</i> </span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Finally, we have to look at all the prescription drugs now being begged
    for by parents, prescribed by medical doctors and taken by children, and see
    what role these play in causing these slaughters of the innocent.</span></p>
  <p><b><span style=''>So <span>is this explosive, violent, murderous and eventually suicidal
    behavior directly caused by pharmaceutical drugs</span>? ABSOLUTELY!</span></b></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:125%'>Black Box Warnings</span></b><br>
  <span style=''>The FDA has warned us for over a decade about how these drugs backfire
    and cause violent and suicidal behavior in children and adolescents, and later
    increased this warning to include young adults up to the age of 25.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>There is a <b>Black Box Warning</b> on ALL of these types of drugs, the most serious and highest level of warning
    demanded by the FDA stating: <b><i><span style='color:red'>“These drugs may
    increase the risk of suicidal thinking and suicidal behavior in children and
    young adults.”</span></i></b></span></p>
  <p><b><i><span style=''>“MAY increase”</span></i></b><b><span style=''> IS NOT
    TRUE. </span></b><span style=''>In every study done, these drugs<b> ABSOLUTELY DID INCREASE the suicidal thinking and suicidal behavior!</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>In some studies the results were squashed quickly, up to 35% of the
    participants experienced suicidal thoughts and many others attempted suicide.
    But the final percentage was the minimal, and lowered to a 4% increase. The
    final medical decision was the typical and usual, “The benefit of these drugs
    outweigh the 4% negative side effects”.&nbsp; This means that if we believe the drug manufacturers, out of 100 kids
    taking these drugs, a minimum of 4 will have suicidal thinking and suicidal
    behavior. The harsh reality is that your kids are locked in a school with other
    kids that are at least thinking about killing themselves, if not killing
    everyone else FIRST.</span></p>
  <p><i><span style='color:red'>From the FDA.gov website…</span></i></p>
  <p><b><span style='color:red;font-size:125%;'>Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs </span></b><br>
  <b><i><span style='color:red'>Antidepressants increased the risk
    compared to placebo of suicidal thinking AND BEHAVIOR (suicidality) in
    children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major
    depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering
    the use of [Insert established name] or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent,
    or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term
    studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with
    antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a
    reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65
    and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves
    associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are
    started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and
    observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in
    behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close
    observation and communication with the prescriber. [Insert Drug Name] is not
    approved for use in pediatric patients. [The previous sentence would be
    replaced with the sentence, below, for the following drugs: Prozac: Prozac is
    approved for use in pediatric patients with MDD and obsessive compulsive
    disorder (OCD). Zoloft: Zoloft is not approved for use in pediatric patients
    except for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Fluvoxamine:
    Fluvoxamine is not approved for use in pediatric patients except for patients
    with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).] (See Warnings: Clinical Worsening
    and Suicide Risk, Precautions: Information for Patients, and Precautions:
    Pediatric Use) </span></i></b><i></i></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:125%;'>The
    FDA Bottom Line</span></b><br>
    <b><span style='color:red'>All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication
    should be monitored appropriately and OBSERVED CLOSELY for clinical worsening,
    SUICIDALITY, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few
    months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either
    increases or decreases. </span></b></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:125%;'>In Closing</span></b><br>
  <span style=''>Let’s not blame hairstyles, clothing, music, books, movies, video games,
    or even guns or ammunition, I have heard all of that before. <i>And even though I would like to</i>, we
    cannot even totally blame pharmaceutical drugs, as violence has existed on this
    planet long before any of these things.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Let’s put the blame right where it belongs, on the adults surrounding
    this emotionally ill kid, who were supposedly supervising him. Sure, he may
    have made bad choices in life, but the adults around him made worse choices
    while watching him drown in his own depression. They used condemnation and
    drugs instead of love and hugs, and the first therapy has ruined more kids’
    lives than the Beatles haircuts, Elvis’s hips, or the Beat Generation Poets.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>In every case of these violent mass murders, the parents, the
    principals, the social workers, the teachers and the medical doctors prescribing
    the drugs, ALL knew well ahead of the incident that these kids were emotionally
    unwell, had problems, were displaying inappropriate or weird behavior, and
    worse, <b>they knew these children were
    taking medically prescribed drugs that are known to backfire, are known to
    cause suicidal thoughts and known to cause suicidal behavior and incidents, AND
    THEY DID NOTHING ABOUT IT!</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>This is the problem, <b>and this is
    also the solution!</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>My love goes out to the parents, and my prayers go to the children.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>&#8212;&nbsp;Dr. Schulze</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>PS: Instead of putting schools on lockdown, maybe we should consider putting
    kids on dangerous behavior-modifying medications that are displaying anti-social
    tendencies in a room and LOCKING THE DOOR, and keep them away from the rest of
    the kids who just want to have a fun day. OK, I said it, and this will get me a
    thousand hate mail letters.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style=''><span style=''>Dear Friends,</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>I have interrupted my new BLOG VIDEO releases, answering
    your questions, to bring you this very timely and important <span
style='color:#B5111B;'>"Special Clinical Tips"</span> update.</span></b></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:125%;'>I
    Am Doing It With YOU!</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>Today is April 10th,
    2013 and I am currently four days into my own personal first 5-Day BOWEL Detox
    of the year, and I realized that <b>I need
    to update all of you on some of my 5-Day BOWEL Detox&nbsp; <span style='color:#B5111B;'>"Special
    Clinical Tips"</span></b> so you can breeze right through your Detox Program.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>I have already mailed
    you the first monthly installment of my new <a href="https://www.herbdoc.com/index.php/Publication.html?pgtotal=16&pubpage=01&pubtitle=2013-04_Publication" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">Special Report on Detoxification</a>,
    which I will be publishing over the next three months. In this first one, the
    April issue, I start out by explaining to you that EVERYONE is using the word
    "detox" nowadays, especially all the new "hip" medical doctors on their
    television shows, even though they have no clue of what a detox really is, let
    alone how to do one. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>Then I explain what a
    detox really is, and underscore the importance of making a seasonal detox part
    of your healthy lifestyle. So this month you will get my new Bowel Detox
    Special Report. Next month, in May, you will receive my Liver/Gallbladder Detox
    Special Report, and in June, my Kidney/Bladder Detox Special Report.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:125%;'>OK,
    What Are These <span style='color:#B5111B;'>"SPECIAL CLINICAL TIPS"?</span></span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style='color:#B5111B;'>TIP #1: USE THE POWDER</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>Use the Intestinal Formula
    #2 POWDER when doing my 5-Day BOWEL Detox. Unless you are in the top 1% of
    being ridiculously squeamish, USE THE POWDER! Even though the Intestinal
    Formula #2 is EXACTLY the same herbal powder, whether you are using the POWDER
    or the powder CAPSULES, you should experience using the POWDER and making the
    drinks. First, it works better because you are premixing it with water and
    juice (<i>with the capsules it has to mix in
    your stomach</i>). Second, you are assured you are getting enough liquid <span>intake</span>, to make the formula work its best. Third, if you ever have food poisoning (and most of you will at some point), you will know exactly how to make my
    "Black Drink". Come on, I know it’s black, <i>but
    it doesn’t taste black!</i></span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style='color:#B5111B;'>TIP #2: WATERBOARDING OR DETOX</span></b><br />
  <b><span style=''>First, use a LITTLE LESS liquid… </span></b><span
style=''>It
    is VERY important to consume enough liquid to ACTIVATE the Intestinal Formula
    #2 and make it work. <b>The more liquid you
    consume the better!</b> So, in all of my instructions I really push hard on
    consuming enough liquid when doing my Bowel Detox. After all, dehydration and
    not consuming enough liquid is one of the main reasons for constipation in the
    first place.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>But some people,
    especially if they are doing the ADVANCED Program, and also juice flushing
    (which is how I always do it) can find it a little hard to consume ALL THIS
    LIQUID in the course of the day. Remember, it’s five 16-ounce IF#2 drinks, plus
    four to five 20-ounce juice drinks. <b>Add
    in a little of my Potassium Broth and you will feel like this is more of a Dr.
    Schulze Waterboarding Program than a Bowel Detox. </b></span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>The simple solution to this: </span></b><span
style=''>All
    of my instructions call for making the Intestinal Formula #2 drink using 8
    ounces of pure water, and 8 ounces of fresh organic fruit juice, which makes a
    bulky 20-ounce drink once you add in the IF#2 herbal powder and shake it up.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>INSTEAD, use only 5
    ounces of pure water, and 5 ounces of fresh organic fruit juice, with the same
    rounded teaspoon of Intestinal Formula #2. This makes a smaller 10 to 11-ounce
    IF#2 drink, which reduces each drink by at least 8 ounces and reduces your
    total daily consumption by <b>40 OUNCES</b> of liquid. This makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE in your ability to get <span>ALL of the</span> IF#2 drinks in.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>Normally I would be
    worried that you are NOT getting enough liquid intake to fully <i>activate </i>the herbal powder, but if you
    are doing your detox the ADVANCED way with Juice Flushing, you are getting
    plenty of liquid so I AM NOT WORRIED!</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>If you follow my
    DRINK SCHEDULE in my next TIP, you will be getting PLENTY of liquid to <i>activate</i> the IF#2 Powder and have a
    GREAT and EFFECTIVE Bowel Detox.</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style='color:#B5111B;'>TIP #3: FIRST THING IN THE MORNING</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>Some people find it
    hard to get five Intestinal Formula #2 drinks in during the day. And the next
    thing they notice is that it is evening, they are hungry, and they have only
    had three drinks instead of five. I have the EASY solution for you…</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>Have your first Intestinal Formula #2 drink first thing in
    the morning, upon arising.</span></b><span style=''> This gets you ahead of schedule
    and solves the problem with drinking all five doses each day.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>The following schedule
    is EXACTLY how I do my 5-Day BOWEL Detox, and how I suggested my all of my
    patients do it, to make it very easy to get ALL FIVE Intestinal Formula #2
    drinks in during the day.</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style='font-size:125%;'>Dr. Schulze’s 5-Day BOWEL Detox </span></b><br />
  <b><span style='font-size:125%;'>(Drink Schedule)</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>7 am (or upon arising)</span></b><span style=''></span><br />
  <b><span style=''>Have your first Intestinal Formula #2 drink</span></b><span
style=''> right after you wake up. Get up, walk to the kitchen, pour 5 ounces of water
    into a jar or a sports bottle, add your rounded teaspoon of Intestinal Formula
    #2, add 5 ounces of any fresh, organic fruit juice, SHAKE it up, and drink it
    down. NOTE: Don’t let the drink set, as it will turn into thick jello in less
    than five minutes. I want this happening in your digestive system, not in the glass!</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>8am: Workout</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>This is when I get my
    hour of daily movement.</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>9am: <span>Break-Fast</span></span></b><br />
  <span style=''>This is when I make
    my morning blender <b>SuperFood Drink </b>with
    fresh juices, fresh fruit, raw nuts and seeds and of course SuperFood Plus. If
    you take any other herbal supplements, like PROTECT, or any of my herbal
    tonics, this is also a great time to take them, as the IF#2 drink will absorb
    some of your supplements also.</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>10:30-ish: Second Drink</span></b><span style=''> </span><br />
  <span style=''>Now it’s time for
    your second <i>reduced-liquid</i> <b>Intestinal Formula #2 drink.</b></span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>Noon or 1pm: Lunch </span></b><br />
  <span style=''>This is when I have
    my lunch Nutritional Drink. This is always where I get my veggies. Lately, I
    have been adding two huge handfuls of Kale and one handful of Spinach into my
    Vita-Mix. Next, I add some water, the juice of a lemon, and some fresh organic
    vegetable juice or even sometimes fruit juice. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>Friends, if you are
    not used to this much veggie consumption, add in some apple or even some
    pineapple juice and you won’t even notice all the spinach and kale you are
    drinking. Remember SUCCESS FIRST, food combining second.</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>2-ish: Third Drink</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>Consume your third <i>reduced-liquid</i> <b>Intestinal Formula #2 drink.</b></span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>3 or 4-ish: SuperFood Bar </span></b><br />
  <span style=''>Some days,<b> </b>about 3 or 4 o’clock, I get a little
    hungry. If I do, this is when I consume a SuperFood Bar. It’s Raw Food; it’s
    OK!</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>5 or 6-ish: Fourth Drink</span></b><span style=''> </span><br />
  <span style=''>Consume your fourth <i>reduced-liquid</i> <b>Intestinal Formula #2 drink.</b></span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>7 or 8pm: Dinner</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>This is the time when
    you can either have another SuperFood or Nutritional drink of your choice or a
    raw fruit or veggie salad. If you are really hungry, try some raw flax seed
    crackers (they help the bowel cleanse) and some raw nut / bean pate.</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>9pm (or bedtime)</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>Have your fifth and
    final <b>Intestinal Formula #2 drink </b>of
    the day.</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>AND DON’T FORGET: With or just after dinner, be sure to take
    your INTESTINAL FORMULA #1, or your IF#1 Maximum-Strength, or even a Bowel
    Flush "SHOT"!</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>If you follow this schedule, you will find it EASY to
    consume ALL of your 5-Day BOWEL Detox Drinks!</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style='color:#B5111B;'>TIP #4: STAY CALM &amp; GET CLEAN!</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>I had some patients
    who panicked if they went a day with no bowel movement. DON’T WORRY!!! The
    Intestinal Formula #2 can actually slow down your bowel, and even make you skip
    a day. Just keep increasing your dosage of Intestinal Formula #1 every night
    until you have a bowel movement the next day, or take a Bowel Flush "SHOT" at
    night and then you will be guaranteed that all of the Intestinal Formula #2,
    AND EVERYTHING ELSE, will come out of you the very next morning.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>There are no downsides to skipping a day of bowel movements. In fact, having 10 doses of the Intestinal Formula
    #2 inside your bowel is a GOOD thing. The formula is designed to hug to the
    walls of your colon, and SOFTEN and DRAW OFF and ABSORB any old fecal sludge,
    debris or toxic waste, <b>so more "hang
    time" is just fine!</b></span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>FINALLY…</span></b><br />
  <span style=''>Look friends, I have
    been doing bowel detoxes and cleanses and fasts and juice flushes for 45 years
    now. I always say, <b>"It’s ironic that it
    takes a lifetime to learn how to live!"</b> Well, it also takes a lifetime to
    perfect the art of Cleansing and Detoxification, and making it easier and more
    fun.</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>&#8212;&nbsp;Dr.
    Schulze</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style='font-size:125%;'>PS:</span></b><span style='font-size:125%;font-family:
Arial;"Times New Roman"'> <b>Why Detoxification?</b></span><br />
  <span style=''>Spring is classically
    "spring cleaning" or what I call Detoxification Season. Your grandparents knew
    this. Every American traditionally had some sort of spring cleanse herbal tonic
    "spring tonic" that they used or had some special herbs they consumed, or a
    food program change. The reason for this is simply that after hunkering down
    for the past three to six months&#8212;after a long, hard winter&#8212;our
    bodies are a bit congested. In the winter we get less fresh air, less exercise,
    more calories, more fat, not to mention a few colds or flu. All of this thicker
    food and less exercise is important, and it helps our bodies deal with the
    colder weather. But, more calories and fat and less movement also contributes
    to everything from thicker blood and more fat storage to <span>fattier</span> muscles and waste accumulation. We are more like a Kobe beef cow now and we
    need to get back to being more like a thoroughbred horse&#8212;lean and fit!</span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>So naturally, one of the VERY FIRST things to do for <span>yourself</span> over the next few months is a little "spring
    cleaning" to flush out the old winter waste, sludge and toxins that have
    naturally accumulated during your winter hibernation. This will LAUNCH you into
    summer, feeling GREAT and having tons of ENERGY!</span></b></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[  <p><b><span style=''>Friends, I am interrupting this
    week’s Video Blog with a special commentary. </span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>Since
    Angelina Jolie’s voluntary breast removal story hit the press yesterday, my
    office has been flooded with calls and e-mails from friends and acquaintances
    regarding this subject, and what my opinion is on such a radical <i>preventative</i> surgery. Readers are also
    starting to flood my BLOG with similar questions so let me address this issue,
    yet once again.</span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:135%;color:#B5111B'>What’s Going On?</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>It is
    common medical knowledge that we are all genetically predisposed to certain
    diseases. We are the genetic products of our mother and our father. Therefore
    we all have the predisposition to develop inherited strengths <i>and weaknesses</i> (or diseases), passed
    down by them. This does NOT mean that we will develop the same health problems
    or die from the same diseases that our parents did. It simply means that our
    chances <i>may</i> be elevated. I will
    explain more on this later, and more important, <b>how YOU can AVOID manifesting any genetic family diseases.</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>But
    specifically, with breast cancer, scientists <i>think</i> that they have discovered a gene, they refer to as BRCA1,
    that is a genetic marker for the potential development of breast cancer. The
    reason I say “<i>think</i>” is simply
    because almost all this testing science is proven false or at least faulty a
    decade or so later, like the AIDS test, or the PSA test for prostate cancer
    (that has now been proven defective), or giving millions of mammograms to young
    women whose breast tissue was too dense to see anything, which caused breast
    cancer and so this practice is now condemned. <b>Regardless of the history of medical testing blunders, many women who
    test positive for this particular BRCA1 gene are now opting to have their
    healthy breasts removed, as did Angelina Jolie in February. </b></span></p>
  <p><b><span style='color:#B5111B'>And I am telling you right
    now, that in a decade or two, surgically cutting off healthy breasts because
    someone tests positive for the BRCA1 gene will be seen as a huge horrific
    medical mistake.</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>Regarding Angelina’s decision, personally I think it is an ignorant mistake. We are all just doing the best we can with the information that we have. When faced with possible death, who knows what each of us will decide? On the other hand, she was not faced with death, she is currently healthy, and I do not believe that her doctors gave her the whole picture, the whole truth, and if they had, her decision may have been very different, and not based on fear, disease and death but instead focusing on getting really healthy and staying really healthy. <b>So I don’t mind her ignorance, but what I do mind is her preaching her ignorance, and being some spokeswoman for BRCA1 genes. FEAR, negativity, and being a spokeswoman for the trillion-dollar medical and pharmaceutical industry that is getting rich by exploiting women’s fears—now she is becoming a spokeswomen to convince other women to cut off their own healthy breasts.</b></span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:135%;color:#B5111B'>There Is A Positive Side
    To Testing Positive</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>NOTE: A
    positive test for this BRCA1 gene DOES NOT MEAN that you will develop breast
    cancer in your lifetime. In fact, if you have no family history of breast
    cancer, your odds of developing it are only slightly increased over the general
    population, like 10%. Your odds are much higher to develop breast cancer by
    simply living on a farm than having this gene, which can cause a 20% to 40%
    increase in breast cancer, but no one is suggesting that all farmers’ daughters
    have their breasts chopped off are they? </span></p>
  <p><b><span style='color:#B5111B'>It is common medical
    knowledge that when doctors say you have a family history, or a family tendency
    to develop a particular disease, or even a marker gene that can mutate, it is
    USUALLY NOT the genetic defect that causes the disease, but what the family ate
    and the environment that the family lived in, that caused this gene to mutate.</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>But doctors
    say if you have a relative who did have breast cancer, and you have the BRCA1
    gene, then your chances are increased up to 80%. <i>Again, more on how to NOT manifest genetic diseases later.</i></span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:135%;color:#B5111B'>Bottom Line First</span></b></p>
  <p><b><span style=''>The only reason a woman would cut
    off her healthy breasts is FEAR.</span></b><span style=''> Fear often caused by watching a close relative or loved one
    die of cancer, or specifically breast cancer. FEAR promoted by medical doctors
    and cancer researchers who all know better. FEAR promoted by hospitals and
    medical doctors because they make billions of dollars annually using this fear
    to sell their horrific medical procedures.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>The late
    President Franklin D. Roosevelt stated, “The only thing we have to fear, is
    fear itself…nameless, unjustified terror that paralyses us into retreating, <b>instead of advancing</b>”.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>FEAR,
    darkness, negativity, disease, causing us to retreat instead of advance. Wow,
    what a great statement. This couldn’t be truer than in this instance. FEAR
    causing us to cut off healthy body parts instead of learning how to shut off
    bad genes and Creating Powerful Health. </span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:135%;color:#B5111B'>Medical Doctors Should Be
    Ashamed</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>After all,
    it is their oath, <i>not mine</i>, that
    states, “Do No Harm”, and surgical removal of healthy body parts is definitely
    harmful, not just physically harmful <i>and
    risky, </i>as is any surgical procedure, but also harmful are all the drugs
    used for this type of surgery from anesthetics and antibiotics to the pain
    killers. Trust me, every single day patients all across America are dying from
    hospital contracted bacterial infections, cancer caused by x-rays and CT scans
    and lives are ruined by pain killing drugs and patients are killed by
    pharmaceutical drugs. There are 1,000 potential risks from undergoing any type
    of surgery. And I have not even mentioned the emotional and spiritual harm
    caused to a woman by having this type of surgery. I saw the negative aftermath
    of mastectomies in my clinic, one too many times.</span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:135%;color:#B5111B'>How to AVOID Genetic
    Diseases</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>Don’t let
    medical doctors terrify you into making horrifying, life-changing decisions!
    And don’t let them talk you into cutting off healthy body parts.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>All that genetic
    markers say is that you have the potential to develop a disease, like breast
    cancer. It simply means that you have genes in your body, that when <i>stimulated,</i> <i>irritated</i> or <i>woken up</i>,
    can mutate and develop into cancer. Well, what wakes these genes up is no
    mystery, and ALL medical and cancer researchers know exactly what turns these
    genes on, but they don’t want to touch this subject, simply because it’s
    unpopular. <b>What turns these genes on and
    makes them mutate, is junk food, toxic chemicals, French fries, pharmaceutical
    drugs… the list is long; it’s the aftermath of the American Dream.</b></span></p>
  <p><span style=''>Studies in
    Israel and even worldwide have proven the direct link between cows’ milk
    consumption and breast cancer. The growth hormones and steroids <i>naturally</i> present in cows’ milk are
    genetically designed to create a COW, not a human, and consumption of these
    alien hormones has been associated with cancer. Worse, if the cows have been
    subjected to additional growth hormones and steroids, <b>which almost all are in America</b>, because the use is rampant in the
    dairy industry, well, your odds of developing cancer are much greater. But no
    one is talking about women not consuming cow dairy products. </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>And maybe
    the greatest known risk factor to cause breast cancer is the use of hormones,
    like taking birth control pills or the supplemental use of hormones for
    menopause. This can increase your risk of developing breast cancer much greater
    than if you have the BRCA1 gene and a mother who had breast cancer. <b>Taking hormones can increase your risk of
    cancer 15 TIMES (1,500%)! </b></span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style=''>Dr.
    Angela Lanfranchi, a breast surgical oncologist and cofounder of the Breast
    Cancer Prevention Institute, calls the contraceptive pill a “Molotov cocktail”
    for breast cancer!</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>Additionally,
    there are hundreds of environmental toxins that are known to cause breast
    cancer like heavy metals to toxic chemicals and pollutants, to numerous
    chemicals added to the food we eat or the water we drink, to even the
    containers the food and drink comes in. There are even negative emotions that
    are now known to cause cancer.</span></p>
  <p><span style=''>The bottom
    line is that what causes someone to develop cancer, specifically breast cancer,
    is not so much the genetic predisposition, as what your mother ate, drank and
    the environment she grew up in and was exposed to. And, if she developed breast
    cancer, and you continue to live, eat, drink and even think the same way she
    did, well, then you can certainly expect to have an increased breast cancer
    risk.</span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:135%;color:#B5111B'>BUT… </span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>Now here is
    the big ‘BUT’… If you CHANGE, and do not live like your mother, and don’t live
    in the same possibly toxic environment, and don’t eat the same food, and don’t
    drink the same drinks, and don’t take the same pharmaceutical drugs, and don’t
    wear the same clothes, and don’t expose yourself to the same household
    chemicals, and don’t breathe the same air, and don’t think the same thoughts,
    and don’t torture yourself physically, emotionally and spiritually like your
    mother did to herself, then why would your body develop cancer? The answer is
    simply that these genes would NOT be stimulated and you would NOT develop
    cancer!</span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:135%;color:#B5111B'>Bottom, Bottom Line</span></b></p>
  <p><span style=''>From a blog
    I wrote a few years ago on this same subject...</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''><i>"Remember, your level of health is determined
    by your GENETICS REACTING to your LIFESTYLE, meaning, that you may be
    genetically predisposed to reproductive cancer (and there is nothing that you
    can do about that, that's water under the bridge) but if you create a powerfully
    healthy lifestyle, again, not just physically, but also emotionally and
    spiritually, well, you simply WILL NOT develop reproductive cancer. </i></span></p>
  <p style=''><i><span style=''>On the other hand, if you live in a similar way as your parents did, or even a lower quality or lower health lifestyle, well, you can expect a similar outcome, possibly creating Reproductive Cancer.
For all of us, the best way to PREVENT genetic weaknesses (family diseases) from developing in our bodies, and the best way to pass on stronger genetic coding to our children, is to live a healthy life. I don’t want to sound like a German geneticist or Dr. "Adolph" Schulze here, but this is a very basic law of Nature. The weak become diseased and die out and the strong survive, and get stronger, and I want to make sure that you are strong, healthy, live long, and that we will all create stronger and healthier future generations."</span></i></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style='font-size:135%;color:#B5111B'>Finally, and MOST
    IMPORTANT!!!</span></b></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>Remember
    one thing…</span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>It is NOT
    what you inherit… </span></p>
  <p style=''><span style=''>It is how
    you LIVE that can either turn on, or turn off, genes that are predisposed to
    disease. <b>But let’s get our minds out of
    the negative medical gutter.</b></span></p>
  <p style=''><b><span style='color:#B5111B'>I ask you to STOP being medically
    negative for a moment and just imagine that we also have genes in our body that
    are predisposed to greatness&#8212;genes for powerful strength, powerful
    health, brilliance, genius and maybe even super powers, physically, emotionally
    and spiritually. Let us STOP living in FEAR and dwelling about your genes that
    can possibly turn into a disease, and instead START THINKING about living a
    healthy lifestyle and a life that turns your other super-health genes and
    super-power-genes on! YES!!!</span></b></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Viewers,</p>

<p>Last week we changed our Video Player to make your viewing of my videos much better. I also included a button at the end of each video text for you to send any video directly to your friends.</p>

<p><b>This process did not go as smoothly as I had hoped.</b></p>

<p>During this transition to the new video player, some customers in America and around the world could not access my BLOG site, or if they could, they could not play my most recent video on St. John's Wort.</p>

<p><b>The good news is that now my BLOG is fully up-and-running,</b> and the new video player is accessible to everyone around the world. I am truly sorry if you experienced any problems, and if you still do, please <a class="email" title="Email Tech Support" href="mailto:websupport@herbdoc.com?subject=Dr. Schulze's BLOG Video Problem&body=Dear Dr. Schulze BLOG Team: %0D%0DI am unable to view the videos. I am using __________* as my web browser.%0D%0DThank you,%0D%0D
%0D%0D*Please specify your web browser name and version # if possible (ex: Safari 5.1.9,%0D%0D
Firefox 3.6.15, etc.) so we can more quickly assist you and resolve the issue.">Contact Us</a> immediately.</p>

<p>Finally, because of this problem, I am running my <a href="http://herbdocblog.com/article/Video/medicinal-herbsst-johns-wort/">St. John's Wort Video</a> for an additional week, so everyone worldwide has a chance to view it. Next week, I will continue my new videos I am filming here in Italy!</p>

<p>Again, I am sorry for any inconvenience or problems you had trying to access my BLOG or in viewing the Videos.</p>

<p>— Dr. Schulze</p>]]></content:encoded>
