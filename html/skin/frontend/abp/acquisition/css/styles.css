 * Usage:
 * 1. create two folders in your image directory (in this case 'icons' and 'icons-2x').
 * 2. adjust the foldernames defined below if you use different names.
 * 3. create sprite images for pixel ratio 1 screens and put them in the first folder.
 * 4. create sprite images for pixel ratio 2 screens and put them in the second folder, use the same filenames.
 * 5. use the sprite-image in your Sass/Scss using: '@include use-sprite(<sprite-name>)'

 * Retina Sprites for Compass
 * by:              Gaya Kessler
 * last update:     03/11/14
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. create two folders in your image directory (in this case 'icons' and 'icons-2x').
 * 2. adjust the foldernames defined below if you use different names.
 * 3. create sprite images for pixel ratio 1 screens and put them in the first folder.
 * 4. create sprite images for pixel ratio 2 screens and put them in the second folder, use the same filenames.
 * 5. use the sprite-image in your Sass/Scss using: '@include use-sprite(<sprite-name>)'
